		<description><![CDATA[In light of the recent changes at SISTERS, Khadijah Stott-Andrew reflects on everything she loves about the magazine and the team ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was 13 when we headed to the conference. I had been before, and I always looked forward to the same things &#8211; the food, the semolina served at dinner, staying up late, tea and biscuits in our rooms, the stalls… the stalls were probably my favourite part. I would spend most of the year saving up my pocket money so that I would be able to spend those four glorious days purchasing books, ‘abayahs, jewellery and more books. But one thing didn’t excite me &#8211; the lectures. I found them boring. I found they didn’t apply to me; I didn’t feel that zealous excitement when the scholar spoke. When others shed tears, I checked my watch. When others hastily scrawled as many notes as possible, I wandered off to the book stalls. I was a 13 year old girl still discovering my identity. As a daughter of a revert mother and with a non-Muslim father I saw once a week, I had two different lifestyles pulling at me. I knew where I wanted to belong &#8211; Islam was the right path, Allah SWT existed and Judgement day was coming. I knew and believed all of this, but Islam and a love for the deen was far away from my heart. I wanted to belong in the Ummah &#8211; I just didn’t feel like I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, one day, the book stall had some new arrivals. I excitedly hurried over as I saw a bright magazine cover with a drawing of faceless sister in a pink hijab being embraced by a faceless brother. The pale blue letters at the top invited me over: SISTERS. The magazine was quarterly back then, and this issue was all about love; love of your family, love of your spouse and love of yourself. I was intrigued and flicked through the colourful, beautiful pages. I paid for the magazine and headed back to the lecture hall to sit beside my mum as I read through the articles. I fell in love with its friendly tone and engaging topics, but one article about the writer finding support from her younger sisters touched me the most. For the first time since my pre-teen years, I cried for something other than self-pity. I was crying from inspiration and I was crying out of love for the religion that gives so many people strength in difficult times, a religion that brought people together in a few simple pages of a magazine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read that copy of the magazine several times. Then, a few months later, I walked into our familiar Islamic bookshop, and to my absolute delight found a new issue of SISTERS by the counter. I returned to that bookshop every few months to get a new copy, always eager to read new articles and admire the breathtaking designs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I was a different person. I was married and had an almost two-year-old son running around my two-bedroom flat. I was just starting out my freelance proofreading and editing business and wanted to gather together some writers to contribute to a one-off online publication. In an ambitious and hesitant move, I contacted sister Na’ima. Not only was she the editor-in-chief of my beloved magazine, but also the author of my favourite book (interestingly, From My Sisters’ Lips had also been a guidance in my turbulent teens). Whilst asking for her contribution, and unsure if I would even get a reply, I was offered something else: a job opportunity. It was a short contract, just a couple months of copy editing, but I jumped at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was introduced to the SISTERS team and felt overjoyed! I was working behind the scenes of the very magazine that had kept my iman alive through some of the most difficult years of my life. I completed my contract with them and went on my way… only to return a month later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward a few more years and I am living in another country with my husband, and we now have three beautiful children, masha Allah. And I am still working for the magazine. Although, I don’t want to call it work. You see, the SISTERS team is more than just a temporary contract. It has become more than just a job. These sisters are my family. They are my sisters. I haven’t met them in person (except seeing the lovely Sidat sisters in Costa one year!) but they have provided me with invaluable strength and support through hard times. The casual emails and personal friendships make work a delight, not a chore. But this joy isn’t restricted to the editorial team. The writers I have worked with have blossomed into friendships across the world. One sister helped me sleep-train my toddler. Another had two children at the same time I did and we found a beautiful friendship filled with similarities and shared interests. SISTERS is truly a beautiful establishment. It holds a unique atmosphere that I am yet to discover elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishments like that do not fizzle away. SISTERS is taking a break from print issues, but that doesn’t mean ‘goodbye’. No matter which projects we pursue, editors, writers and readers of SISTERS will always be my family. You’re not getting rid of me that easily.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day a strange man appeared in Medinah. He walked towards the gathering of the Sahabah who were sitting in a semi-circle in front of the Messenger (SAW). There was something different about him. Everyone began to turn and look in his direction. His shiny black hair contrasted with the whiteness of his skin. Why were his clothes so clean, they all wondered. They began to watch him with furrowed brows. “We do not know him, and yet he certainly does not look like a traveller.” They murmured to one another as they took another glimpse at the handsome stranger who carried himself in such a dignified manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The companions were happy when people came to ask questions.  They fell silent and watched with delight as the man approached their group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“O Messenger of Allah (SAW), shall I come nearer to you?” asked the man.<br />
“Yes,” replied the Prophet (SAW).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man knelt down, touching his knees to the front of the Prophet’s (SAW). He then placed his hands on the Prophet’s thighs and asked, “What is Islam?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) replied:  “It is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; to pay Zakaat; to fast the month of Ramadhan; and to perform Hajj to the House (Kaba).”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Then what is iman (Faith)?” the man asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) replied: “It is to believe in Allah, in His Angels, in Paradise, in the Hellfire, in resurrection after death, and in Divine Preordainment in its entirety (which is to believe that Allah I has already decreed everything that happens in our lives, both in terms of blessings and hardships.)”<br />
“Then what is Ihsan?” the man asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) replied:  “It is to perform deeds for Allah as if you can see Him; and if you cannot see Him (which you are unable to do) (then continue to worship Him with fear, submission, sincerity, and full concentration); for indeed, He sees you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And when is the Hour?” the man asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The one being questioned about it knows no more about it than the one asking the questions,” said the Prophet (SAW).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Then what are its signs?” the man asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“(It will be near at hand) when the naked, barefooted, poor shepherds of sheep (become wealthy and) compete with one another in the construction of buildings; and (it will be near at hand) when female slaves give birth to their masters.” Said the Prophet (SAW).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that the man left. The Prophet asked his companions to go and get him, but after searching everywhere they could find no trace of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Days passed and finally the Prophet (SAW) asked Umar (RA) “O Ibn Al-Khattaab, do you know the identity of the questioner who asked (so many questions the other day)?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Allah (SWT) and His Messenger (SAW) know best,” replied Umar (RA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That,” the Prophet (SAW) said, “was (the Angel) Jibreel. He came to teach you your religion.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that moment until this, Jibreel’s questioning of the Prophet (SAW) has taught us the meaning of Islam, Iman, Ihsan, and the signs of the Last Day. This hadith has been dutifully passed down to each generation so that Muslims would understand what constitutes being a Muslim and moreover a Muslim who has iman (faith) and Ihsan.  The lesson was so valuable that Jibreel was ordered to take a human form to deliver it and to do so before all of the Sahabah who witnessed it that day and understood the depths of its meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah states in His Glorious Quran, The bedouins say: &#8220;We believe.&#8221; Say: &#8220;You believe not but you only say, &#8216;We have surrendered (in Islam),&#8217; for Faith has not yet entered your hearts. But if you obey Allah and His Messenger (SAW), He will not decrease anything in reward for your deeds. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; Only those are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the Cause of Allah. Those! They are the truthful.  <em>(Al Hujuraat 14-15)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the hadith and ayah above indicate that being a Muslim/surrendering is different than being a Mumin/having iman. Being a Mumin is of a higher status and should be a goal for any Muslim. Just as Allah reminds the bedouins that faith doesn’t come automatically upon saying shahadah, we too should know that Islam is a journey which doesn’t end at the beginning. Knowledge and faith come with time and effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a revert, I remember the day I took my shahadah and became a Muslim.  It seems like yesterday but it&#8217;s been almost 30 years. Looking back at my journey, I have learned many things about Islam through books, lectures and classes. The more I have learned the more it has changed me and the more I have realised how little I knew then and how far I still have to go. Knowledge in Islam is vast and endless and our quest for it should be the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc1f75;"><strong>How do we attain faith?  </strong></span><br />
Imam Bukhari has informed us that iman is comprised of belief in the heart which includes our intentions. It also includes the statements that cross our tongues and the actions that our limbs take. Iman comes about with knowledge, so the more we learn and apply what we have learned to our lives, the more our hearts will be filled with belief insha Allah. Studying our deen should be an ongoing process so that we can continue to increase in iman rather than decrease, as faith is not something which remains stable but instead is in continuous flux. If it isn’t increasing, it&#8217;s decreasing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc1f75;"><strong>What are signs of faith?  </strong></span><br />
On the authority of Abu Huraira the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “Faith has over seventy branches or over sixty branches, the most excellent of which is the declaration that there is no god but Allah, and the humblest of which is the removal of what is injurious from the path: and modesty is a branch of faith.” <em>(Sahih Bukhari)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this hadith, iman/faith is compared to a tree. As it grows from the heart of the believer, more branches appear. When the roots of that tree are based upon sound and certain knowledge of Qur’an and Sunnah learned for the sake of Allah, He will insha Allah increase the faith in our hearts which will manifest itself in our behaviour. Ideally, we will be steadfast in increasing our ibadah and good deeds, following the way of the Sunnah, while abstaining from bad deeds. Hopefully this cycle would continue, although realistically we have failings and faith is not always on the increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith based on knowledge acted upon by good deeds is how the companions changed from being a divided, quarrelsome, and underdeveloped people into an Ummah which rose to unimaginable heights, changing the course of history forever. True faith today can bring about that same change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the upcoming iman series, we will attempt to increase our knowledge by examining iman in more detail. We will look at the factors Jibreel has outlined for us in the Hadith which take you from submission to belief.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Shabnam Bagheri shares her first experience prostrating to Allah (SWT) and how it lead to a heartache she didn’t know she could ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the evening of December 29, 2012, my knees finally gave way and I fell forward, bowing, head touching the cold, hard ground. Allah (SWT) knows best how long I stayed in that position, weeping, praising Him, making up for the lost times. This act of prostrating to Allah (SWT) was my confirmation and what I felt to be, my entrance into Islam. SubhanAllah, it was as though the past 22 years of my existence was leading up to this moment. My broken heart was made whole again. With every movement, my heart felt restored, returning to its original form, but only to ache once more as my forehead kissed the ground in peaceful submission. This ache was not like before, this was the final ache, the one that leads us back home, not with our heads hanging, but with our hearts singing and tears rolling down our faces from the overwhelming joy. Whatever heartache I experienced before was triumphed by this ultimate heartache, and what I feel, perhaps, to be the true heartache of our lives. To whom other than Allah (SWT) could we feel such gratitude?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
From childhood to adulthood, suffering and pain and fear of suffering and pain has crept into our hearts in all shapes and forms, often consuming us so much that we don’t even know how to live our lives any more. I remember the moment in my childhood when it struck me that my parents would pass away one day. For months on end, I would fall asleep every night with tears dried to my face &#8211; I wept so much I would gasp for air. The remembrance of their death plagued my thoughts. I would even go so far as to plead with Allah (SWT) to let me die first so I would not have to suffer their loss. Astaghfirullah. I was a sensitive child. I still am, but these days, a different kind of remembrance stirs in this heart. And the remembrance of death does not so much fill me with grief any more than it does hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Five times a day we are blessed with the opportunity to give all our sorrows away and place them in the care of Allah Almighty, and in return, He (SWT) transforms our heartache. He gives us a different kind of heartache; it is an ache of longing to meet Him and receive a drop of His <em>Rahmah</em> (Mercy).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some days I feel a deep despair from everything that is happening in our world. Some days it feels the Ummah is falling apart. But perhaps the Ummah has always carried this feeling, ever since the passing of our Beloved Prophet (SAW). But we have been left with the greatest gifts, among them being the five daily prayers. Instead of falling into despair by the tragedies we face in our lives, we may fall down in submission to Allah and simply praise Him and remember: “Surely the Hereafter is better for you than the present.” <em>(Al-Duha:4)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That evening in December sealed the deal for me: Allah (SWT) is the One and only in this life that is real and the only One we can place our full trust and hope in. When we truly praise Him, we feel a private closeness to Him that is like nothing else in this world &#8211; there is a bitter sweetness such that we feel our heart is aching and our eyes are continuously welling up with tears &#8211; it is His sweet and fragrant breezes of Mercy that move us to tears. Every day in <em>sujud</em>, we may return to that place of serenity and sweetness. Allah (SWT) is the only One who can return this tranquility into our hearts; everything else causes our hearts to break and feel sad, but when our hearts ache out of love and fear of Allah (SWT), we are happy because truly, He is putting our heart back together for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O traveller on the road to Truth! May our hearts rejoice in this. May we gather together and celebrate this enormous blessing! Truly, Islam is like a gem that was dropped inside an ocean, and how blessed is the one to have found that gem. If it is held to the light, you may see it shine and reveal it’s true beauty, but if you keep it in darkness, who could ever delight in it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find myself there over and over again &#8211; head to the ground, humbled before my Lord, weeping tears of joy, quietly saying, “Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Ya Rabb, thank you for guiding me.” After His love was planted in my heart,there was no turning back. I knew this meant challenges ahead, but my heart was no longer mine and I have never regretted this in the least.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Anisah Jameel-Hardy felt her life crumbling around her. One day, a prayer uttered from her stable door changed her life forever...]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With most things in my life a ruin, I was left to contemplate the many reasons why I&#8217;d failed; I was in debt, had an unfaithful husband and a life with very little time to spend with my children. I couldn&#8217;t think of any bigger topics in life to be ruined such as these three things: marriage, finance and children. My soon-to-be ex-husband, now living in our spare room, was still battling for our reconciliation; however, after his constant unchaste behaviour, I realised it was a losing battle and divorce was imminent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One rainy evening, I was staring out of my back stable door as I often did. With the rain dripping heavily off the trees into my garden and the wind lightly swaying the leaves, I reverted my eyes towards the skies. I remember thinking as I gazed at the clouds and the stars, &#8220;No debt collector, husband, or anyone for that matter could take those away&#8221;. As I said these words to myself, I pondered on their meaning; at least no one has the power to take the beautiful vision of nature I had from my stable door. That lead me to realise that all these years of hoping that there was a God, now I felt that God was proving to me He was there by showing me His universal power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then found myself pleading with the Lord above me for the next half hour, &#8220;You are there, aren&#8217;t you?&#8230; Please God, guide me now&#8230; I beg of you to guide me now&#8230; I know I&#8217;m not here for this.&#8221; Then, I sobbed and wept and wiped my tears and closed the stable door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next morning, my soon-to-be ex-husband informed me that he desperately needed a motorbike for work. My entire body suddenly went hot and cold like a fever; I&#8217;m going to get into even more debt. I took a deep breath and informed him, &#8220;I won&#8217;t be a party to you borrowing more money. Leave my name out of it.&#8221; There was a small debate, later an argument, until eventually, he told me he was going to borrow this money anyway. Two mornings later, he presented me with paperwork to sign. In signing these papers, I would sign all debt over to him &#8211; over twenty grand&#8217;s worth. This was the only way this loan company would lend him the money; they would handle all his debt. I could hardly believe it. This would mean, apart from the mortgage, I would be completely debt free &#8211; something I had prayed for for years. I signed the papers, handed them back and waited a few days to get the confirmation paperwork. The paperwork arrived, and my name wasn&#8217;t anywhere to be seen on the debt papers. Allahu Akbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three days later, I decided to do something I felt I needed to do at the time: be athletic. So I signed up for a Jujutsu class. It was in this class I met a Muslim brother fasting for Ramadhan. &#8220;Oh yeah!&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;Wait, what&#8217;s that?&#8221;. He told me it was an Islamic obligation. &#8220;And where is Islam?&#8221;, I ignorantly asked. Once his chuckles subsided, he explained things to me, only leading to more questions, and then more questions. From there, he informed me that he was just learning about it himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following week, I looked forward to going to Jujutsu, as I had a page of questions for that brother. As he realised how interested I was, the following week, he brought me a book called <em>Islam: The Natural Way</em>. The next week, we exchanged numbers and I couldn&#8217;t wait to see him again, because another page of questions was fast developing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my journey of knowledge, we were obviously growing attached to each other. Our relationship grew and a year later came to what I&#8217;d describe as a sad but inevitable end. We had recently discovered the rulings around fornication, and the punishments associated with this act almost made me burn inside from fear. I asked the brother to find someone who could help me say my <em>shahadah</em>, which was done in 24 hours. I was now officially a Muslim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me and the brother then decided not to see each other again, as I was now abiding by the same rules as he. As I did everything overnight, including the full hijab and <em>abayah</em>, this was now a very lonely time for me. People at work had no understanding at all about what I was doing, my two sisters thought I had gone mad, and with losing my mother when I was just 19, I had nobody to turn to. As far as the relationship with the brother was concerned, although I was saddened at not seeing him, my worst loss was that there were no more installments in the Islamic knowledge he had been passing on to me. The sisters I had taken <em>shahadah</em> with, I felt, were so politically motivated, and I expressed my concern that I still hadn&#8217;t been taught to pray, and didn&#8217;t they feel this was the most important thing to teach me? One of them agreed and then began to help me learn to pray, Alhamdulillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weeks passed, and in those weeks the brother would drop off a huge bag of halal meat at my back door and leave &#8211; all I managed to see was a glimpse of his head as he walked away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, I received a text from the brother &#8211; I was so excited, I couldn&#8217;t contain myself. The message read: &#8220;Would you like to be my wife?&#8221; Needless to say, my response was a &#8220;yes&#8221;. It had bothered and unnerved me how I, a western woman with two children, with no family and no Muslim connections was going to find a decent, practising Muslim husband. How could I marry someone I didn&#8217;t even know? I turned to my Lord who had rescued me from my previous life, and asked Him to please open a way for this brother and I to marry, if he was indeed a good, practising Muslim that will treat me well. If not, I honestly would not have wanted to marry him, despite my fondness for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next four weeks were tougher than the past two. The brother&#8217;s family ideally wanted a Pakistani bride for their son. However, they agreed to visit me &#8211; and I was extremely nervous as I hadn&#8217;t seen enough of the brother to discuss the meeting with him. They were a very traditional family, but, remarkably, they agreed, provided the wedding was a small affair. The father was interested in why I had become Muslim; had I become Muslim simply to marry his son? It wasn&#8217;t long for him to establish that his son was not the reason I had accepted Islam. I was very grateful to this family, as I had heard many traditional families had very sad stories to tell. They overcame their traditions and followed the sunnah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brother then informed me that once we were married, it would be better for me to either leave my permanent office job or become part-time in preparation to leave. He asked me how I would feel about that. This would enable me to be a full-time mother to my children, which again was something I had prayed for for years. I then realised, bit by bit, the troubles and traumas from my past non-Muslim life were remarkably being taken care of, and we know by Whom, don&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) had answered my du&#8217;a from my stable door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Anisah Jameel-Hardy now has her du&#8217;as answered: she is still happily married with six lovely children she can spend all the time she wants with and two beautiful grandchildren.</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Raeesa Patel describes her love of teaching - and learning from - her students in a South African public school.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After suffering through 12 years of sitting behind an uncomfortable school-desk and trying unsuccessfully to concentrate on what my teacher was saying, it’s not really that difficult to understand why people’s mouths drop open and eyes go wide when I say that I am a teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are days when even I don’t understand it! You are constantly covered in chalk dust… The pay is not the greatest&#8230; the kids you teach can be real monsters at times… tension headaches are part of the course… you are suddenly “mother” to 240 kids or so… and of course&#8230; the relatives and cousins and friends who surprisingly cannot seem to do their homework without calling you for “advice”!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless, I love my job… I look forward to the girls coming to hug me because I took the time out to smile at them as I passed… my day is made when the “bullies” of my class stop to chat with me for a few minutes. And I am absolutely addicted to the moment when comprehension dawns and something that I have been teaching for a while has made sense! On those special days I know that I have chosen the right profession!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how did I get to the point where the prospect of teaching approximately 240 youngsters a day no longer sends me running home, wild-eyed and frothing at the mouth, to my mummy? The very first thing that I had to learn was to truly understand my kids, their culture that is so different from mine, their dressing that sometimes cannot be called “dressing” because that very word implies some sort of covering up, and their ways and mannerisms that can actually be misconstrued as crudity and rudeness by the ignorant onlooker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, I am a South African Indian Muslim female whose only previous experience of teaching came from teaching in a small town Muslim school (population 300). On the 14th of January 2008, I walked into a school that housed more than 800 students – 98% of whom are black South Africans of various religions and ethnicities. Needless to say, all parties involved experienced some sort of culture shock. It took an extremely brave – or precocious – child to ask me if I was really a cancer patient. My blank and uncomprehending stare prompted him to point to my Islamic headgear with a look that spoke volumes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Who’s who? </strong></span><br />
The majority of my children come from broken homes, poor backgrounds and an environment where drugs, alcohol and bad company are readily available. I am, at the very least, 8 years older than my grade 11 students and yet, there are girls in my classroom that are already mother to 2 or more kids. Why? Because the grant given to them by the government is 250 South African rands per child and that paltry sum of money buys them their monthly groceries. In their community, children are beaten by their mothers, abused by their guardians and forgotten by their fathers. Children who come to class, put their heads on the desk and fall into a deep sleep are thought to be lacking ambition, drive and passion. And yet, they’re just simply so exhausted because they are the ones who go home after a school day, cook and clean, look after their siblings, put them to bed, do their own homework, finally go to bed themselves, and then… wake up before the sun does just so that they won’t miss their transport and arrive late for school!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other extreme, I have students who belong to cliques with names such as “Carvela”, “Vibes” and “Princesses of Bling”. The very specific criteria for these highly popular groups? It is essential that  all members embrace the western way of “hip–hop”, that they call each other “dog” and “nigger”, wear their pants in such a way that the crotch sweeps the floor and drape themselves in expensive bling–bling  at all times. Clothes that are not branded are not allowed and money most definitely talks. In lieu of all of this, the club members are sworn to protect each other from enemy gangs. The actual price to pay? Five hundred rand for every school term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Why, oh, why?</strong></span><br />
So yes, it is a challenge to stand up in front of these students, all of whom are brimming over with youthful arrogance and the unshakeable notion that adults are D–U–M–B. But&#8230;I do it because the instant I have their attention, they are mine!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the moment that I wait for: the moment where I can teach my children the difference between right and wrong… the importance of dressing neatly… the value of a kind word… the reasons why they shouldn’t engage in pre-marital sex … the art of conversation … the challenge of not defining themselves by what they see and hear on TV… the beauty of friendliness and anything else that will steer them along their tumultuous journey as hormonal teenagers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In between all of that, I try to teach them about sentence structure, antonyms and synonyms, a Shakespearean poem or play, malapropisms and the basic foundations of the written and spoken English language: things that they will be tested on at the end of the year but which will not really do much to develop their internal moral compasses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me, that is the crux of being an educator: ensuring that your children leave your classroom with a strong sense of integrity that will help them to develop their potential in the best possible way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the fear of every teacher to be informed that a past student has failed to use those tools effectively enough…tools that we gave to him/her. For if they fail, we have failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every child that leaves a school will leave with the opportunity to improve his/her inherent disposition towards virtue in humanity (fitrah), or to give in to their baser desires and become human beings without any humanity. It is my responsibility, as a teacher and as an example, to give my children the tools needed to develop this fundamental character and to teach them how to use them in the big wide world. More than that, I unfortunately cannot do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what do my students teach me? Well… I’ve learnt that skinny jeans look the best on skinny people (hence the name, duh!), that it is sooo not on to blow your nose in class and many other vital bits of information that govern the lives of my students. But most importantly, I’ve learnt that all children just want to love, be loved and laugh. And that behind the makeup and the attitude there’s a child who does not deserve to be judged by the way he/she speaks, moves or thinks. And that no matter where in the world, no matter what race, colour or creed, no matter what school or institution, Allah has created all little (and big) children absolutely exquisite in shape and form and He has given them an amazing capacity to love and to endure. Just look into the eyes of a child and tell me what you see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teaching isn’t just a job for me – it is who I am. When the going gets tough (and it usually does!), all I do is remember what a great ammanat (responsibilty) I have on my shoulders every day and then I realise what an honour I have been blessed with: I have been given the opportunity to try and change the world 40 beautiful kids at a time… and oh how I love it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days most of us might not see the appeal of red camels, but we can certainly appreciate the wealth and prestige that red camels represented at that time. Today&#8217;s equivalent might be a Mercedes-Benz or Cartier jewelry &#8211; luxurious status symbols that almost anyone would love to own. So imagine the breathtaking rewards in store for us if Allah (SWT) chooses to guide someone by us! Being a mentor for a new Muslim is an amazing opportunity to please Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the second part of my series on how to support new converts, I wanted to explore the kind of impact an effective mentor can have on the life of a new Muslim. To find the answer, I interviewed several sisters and asked them if, in their early days as a Muslim, they had been inspired or helped by a more experienced sister. If so, what did she do to assist them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was clear from the converts&#8217; answers that their mentors had an enormous and meaningful impact on their life. Without exception, the sisters I interviewed had loving and grateful words for the women who stood by them as they began their journey towards Allah (SWT). As I immersed myself in their fascinating and heartwarming stories, I noticed that several words kept turning up:  &#8220;non-judgmental,&#8221; &#8220;patient,&#8221; &#8220;caring,&#8221; and &#8220;encouraging.&#8221; These are clearly some of the main attributes of an excellent role model and the characteristics that we should all keep in mind if we are ever blessed to serve as an adviser to a new sister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ana Bdaiwi, a Mexican/American sister who is a mother of five, remembers her first mentor, whom she met twenty-three years ago. &#8220;When I first accepted Islam at the age of nineteen, I had a mentor, Angie, who was also a convert,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;When I would see Angie, I would see Islam. She was beautiful in character and manners, always polite and most respectful. She would always ask if things were too overwhelming or not explained clearly. She always cleared things up and made sure she left a positive impression of Islam, since she was an ambassador of her deen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I often felt I wasn&#8217;t doing things right,&#8221; admits Ana, &#8220;but Angie encouraged me to keep trying. After three months of lessons with her, I decided I was ready to sport my scarf. I was embarrassed for not doing so prior to that. But she never judged me. She did, however, lay the facts out. I was extremely intrigued by everything she said about Islam. She taught me so many details that I&#8217;m so very grateful to her. One of the most important things I learned from Angie, apart from the importance of tawheed, was the importance of humility. Prior to Islam, I was rather conceited. I stomped it out from my life rather immediately, alhamdulillah, because Angie told me, &#8216;Allah is pure and Islam is pure, so a believer should be, too.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as Ana was taught and inspired by a more experienced Muslimah, she, in turn, became a mentor. Sister Liliana, a mother of two who embraced Islam in January, 2014, is one of the sisters whom Ana has helped. &#8220;I feel very blessed and loved by Allah to have Ana Bdaiwi and Hajar Jaidi as my mentors,&#8221; Liliana explains.  &#8220;When things became complicated and I became distant, these individuals stayed caring, loving, considerate and understanding. They did not judge me and only showed support. They never pushed and were always gentle. Most important for me, they never gave up or forgot. This touched me in ways I can never repay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some converts, like Asiyah Shazareen Khan, had to overcome especially difficult situations on their path to practising Islam. For people like Asiyah, the mentors were more than teachers; they were like loving family members. Asiyah explains, &#8220;I was born into a Muslim home and knew the basics of Islam but it wasn&#8217;t until 2012 that I first started to research Islam on my own. I was in an abusive relationship prior to accepting Islam, and it took months of counselling and encouragement from many organisations, family members and friends before I had the self-awareness and courage to declare my faith. The first sister who opened her heart to me and taught me self-discipline was Cahide Sen. She woke me up for Fajr. She counselled me continuously and patiently. She fed me and housed me when I didn&#8217;t have a job and still puts up with me to this day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asiyah also benefited from an official support group. &#8220;I feel very blessed,&#8221; she says, &#8220;in that I have been able to access assistance from the Islamic Institute of Orange County&#8217;s new Muslim Mentor Program, which is phenomenal. My mentor, Sr. Anita Bond-Salama, is like a mother to me. She helps me talk things through and provides emotional support and practical tips on how to be successful in incorporating the basics of Islam into my daily life and routine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Antoinette Hatchell, who embraced Islam in March, 2014, considers herself a lifelong journeyer who has finally found the right path. Like Asiyah, her mentor is Anita Bond-Salama. &#8220;She&#8217;s been more than a mentor; she&#8217;s been a good friend,&#8221; says Antoinette. &#8220;She&#8217;s an amazing person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I took my shahadah after studying world religions for many years,&#8221; explains Antoinette. &#8220;Attending an open house at a mosque really started me on my journey. I met Muslims, asked questions and started learning about the history of the Prophet (SAW). I was fascinated. I took my shahadah and got a phone call that very same day from Anita. She offered to be my mentor. She helped me with salah first of all; establishing my five daily prayers was the first priority. Then she helped me get through my first Ramadhan and even met me at the taraweeh prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The main lesson Anita taught me,&#8221; says Antoinette, &#8220;is take things slow and easy, one step at a time. A new convert can get overwhelmed with so many things. She kept me grounded and realistic. She told me to watch out for what I saw on the Internet and to beware of anything that didn&#8217;t ring true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My goal,&#8221; declares Antoinette, &#8220;is to be a mentor to someone else when I have grown in the religion. I think everyone should be assigned a mentor for at least a full year. It&#8217;s critical to their spiritual development. You need a guide so you don&#8217;t get lost. Anita has been an amazing guide for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vaidehi Majmundar, originally from India, was also blessed to have a life-changing mentor. Years ago, when she accepted a job in Dubai, she met a remarkable sister who took her under her wing and taught her about Islam. &#8220;In my job as a manager of a health and fitness facility,&#8221; explains Vaidehi, &#8220;one of my clients was a lady from India, like me. Her name was Mehjabeen Hassan. Mehjabeen and I hit it off right from the beginning because I think I was mesmerised by her personality, which was very calm and peaceful. She was an intelligent lady and had constructive input on everything. Every time I got a chance to talk to Mehjabeen, she was eloquent, compassionate, caring, realistic and a true friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever I borrowed books from her or visited her house,&#8221; remarks Vaidehi, &#8220;she would make me feel as if I was part of her family. Her kids would call me aunty. Her husband would graciously give us time to talk. She defended me when people tried to take advantage of me. She truly wanted what was the best for me. She was concerned how my parents would take my conversion to Islam, and advised me accordingly. I do not remember even once she mentioned the word &#8216;compassion&#8217;, but I learned compassion from her actions and her speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;After I left Dubai,&#8221; continues Vaidehi, &#8220;Mehjabeen and her family left Dubai as well and went to Canada, where they currently reside. I have lost sister Mehjabeen’s contact information, and I regret that every day! Through this article, I hope insha Allah, Allah (SWT) will put me back in touch with this beautiful sister and friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is clear from these testimonies that the kind of mentors who truly help converts are empathetic, tolerant and gentle. Like the noble Ansar of Madinah who generously housed, fed and protected their Muslim brothers and sisters from Makkah, a great mentor embodies the Islamic ideal of sisterhood and generosity. Surely, Allah (SWT) has enormous rewards in store for the ones who guide others by His mercy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While some people seem to be born with a clear sense of their dreams, other people bounce back and forth, never sure of what they want. I am from the latter group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was born barefoot and stayed that way most summers until I was ten. I loved the outdoors and had a happy childhood in rural Indiana &#8211; but my dream was always to get as far away from my country roots as possible. I wanted to experience the city life. It all looked so glamorous: the fabulous rows of tower blocks and endless pavements, the bustle of people walking up and down the streets, the sheer variety of characters, food, and shopping. It was all so much more appealing than crickets and cows. Once I went to university, I decided I would never look back, the bigger the city, the better. I was delighted when the day finally arrived for my husband and I to move to Cairo &#8211; I was so excited. Finally I would be in one of the of the world’s largest cities: just what I had always wanted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, things are not always as they seem. It didn’t take long for the fascination of apartment life to end. Cities were never meant for children. Having seven of them squeezed into a small flat in Cairo proved to be exhausting, at best. There were people everywhere. It seemed I couldn’t open my apartment door without seeing someone. Just parking the car was a nightmare. Everywhere we went, we had to queue up, most often in a very long queue. The pollution, the noise, the bustle of the people walking up and down the streets was just all too much. I began to long for peace and quiet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I thought a beach house was the solution but no matter how many different beach developments we looked at, they were all full of houses and flats stuck together in endless rows and the same masses were bustling up and down the pavements but this time they were going to and from the beach. The shopping centres in the beach resorts were teeming with people&#8230; I felt I was doomed to exist in a crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a few years, a new kind of development opened up. I saw the full page advertisement in the newspaper and the choir began to sing in the background of my mind and a light beamed down from the heavens. ‘Own your own farm,’ the advertisement said. One acre plots of land could be purchased in the desert outside Cairo for agricultural development; the land prices were cheap and the air was free! We soon reserved our little spot and began to dream about how we could arrange our little farm: the animals here, the trees there, the pond in the middle.  It was all so exciting.  At last I would at least have my weekends of peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within a year, the weekends were expanded and we began to live full-time on our little farm. We had sheep, goats and a dairy cow. Ducks, chickens and wild turkeys were in pens bordering the farm. We planted fruit trees and got a couple of cats. The kids played outside and swam in the pond. I became interested in herb gardening, planting vegetables, spinning, dyeing wool and milking the cow. Owning a farm and having animals was hard work. At the end of most days, I crawled into bed, tired and worn out but it was the good kind of tired that left me satisfied, alhamdulillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I was born living my dream and didn’t even see it. I was happy then but didn’t appreciate it. It all stems from having rida (satisfaction), being content with what we are given. Allah I had put me in the right place but I didn’t value the happiness it gave me. I took it for granted, always imagining that the grass was greener on the other side. My journey led me full circle and, just like the country mouse, I am happy to be back home in the countryside once again drinking my coffee in the cool morning breeze and running my toes through the grass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not over yet, though. Life is not just about having one dream. Most of us have a lot of dreams and I have been working on another dream, one that is even bigger. I want to memorise the whole Qur’an. And, as with all dreams, we ask Allah (SWT) to give us the momentum to begin, the fortitude to endure the hard work and the ultimate ability to achieve all of our dreams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[By Na'ima B Robert]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inside each one of us, there is a desire to be part of something bigger than ourselves; to believe that our lives have a significance beyond our daily routines, work and family dramas; to be an integral part of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look at the people around you who are striving to live purposeful lives, you will notice that they all affiliate themselves with something that matters to them, a cause they believe in. For some, the bigger picture is their extended family, or their neighbourhood, or their ethnic group. And for many of us, the bigger picture is about who we are as Muslims, about the greater Islamic family: the Ummah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a revert, the idea of belonging to a global family defined by the bonds of faith and mutual respect and responsibility is a powerful one. Here, in the arms of the Ummah, we expect to shed the barriers of race, class, culture and caste, and embrace each other as sincere brothers and sisters in faith. We expect to be welcomed, to be valued and to share in each other’s triumphs and tragedies as equals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ideal is especially attractive to those who have braved the scorn of family, friends and the wider society to step into the unknown and start living the ways of our new faith. Having cast much of our old identity aside in favour of a new, more Islamic version of ourselves, we expect the warmth and welcome of our new faith family to ease the pain of this transition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as many reverts will testify, this is not always the case. Often, the euphoria that surrounds a new shahadah is short-lived: offers of assistance begin to flow less freely just as the expectations and demands increase. We experience things we never thought possible when we first embraced Islam: rejection, prejudice, cultural chauvinism, racism, sexism, judgement, pressures related to how we dress, how soon to get married and endless other do’s and don’ts. All of a sudden, the Ummah doesn’t seem such a great place to be any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this is the Ummah on a personal, local level. On an international scale, the Ummah is in a state of loss and turmoil. Success stories are few; stories of war, rebellion, drought and devastation are too many to count. Indeed, if the Muslim Ummah were a physical entity, it would be bleeding, riddled with disease, humiliated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in spite of all its complications and contradictions, there is something special about this community forged by faith. Allah SWT has honoured this community with His guidance, mercy and glad tidings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then there are the little things: the random acts of kindness, selfless generosity, unflinching solidarity and pure love for the sake of Allah SWT, that remind us of what the Ummah could really be. Because the Ummah is not some intangible entity outside of ourselves: it is you and it is me. The Ummah is every single one of us. And if we want to help the Ummah, if we want to improve our condition as Muslims, it starts with us. It starts with us seeking knowledge of this deen so that we can understand where we are going wrong and how to rectify ourselves; it starts with us cleansing ourselves, elevating ourselves, striving to live up to our potential as Muslims. And it starts with us passing on what we learn – to our families, friends, communities, in ever widening circles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, if we do all this, with true sincerity and trust in Allah SWT, do you have any doubt that we will see a change in the condition of the Ummah? That we will be able to taste the sweetness of true brotherhood, true sisterhood? That our communities will become enlightened places of worship, acceptance and joy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t. So how about we get the ball rolling, starting today?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May Allah swt accept all the work that we do within the Ummah and make us a cause for its revival, ameen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Bismillah</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will always remember the first time I truly felt heir to a great legacy as a Muslim woman. It was upon reading the biographies of different sahabiyaat in the book, ‘The Ideal Muslimah’. It couldn’t have come at a better time. Prior to this, I had been feeling a sense of malaise, of discontent with what I saw as limited opportunities for growth within my community. I had begun to feel stifled by what I saw as the one-dimensional image of the ‘true Muslim woman’. Who was she, I asked myself, this cardboard cut-out, this patriarchal fantasy, this cookie cutter Muslimah that I was supposed to be emulating? Why were her options so limited? Why were her horizons so narrow? And why did I feel claustrophobic when I contemplated a life spent trying to live up to her cloistered image?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was not the kind of question that one voiced at the time. Instead, I bit my tongue and sought guidance in Islamic books – maybe the fault was in me and not the stereotype. In an effort to hone my character and quell any signs of rebellion, I began to read the popular book entitled ‘The Ideal Muslimah’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I began reading through it, I found myself somewhat pacified: I enjoyed the author’s way of focusing on a woman’s relationship with Allah SWT before anything else</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I appreciated his recognition of the fact that, first and foremost, a Muslim woman is a slave of Allah </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Everything else follows on from that – the roles of daughter, sister, wife, mother and friend are, in essence, extensions of our worship of our Creator.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if the reminder of the importance of my primary purpose was comforting, the author’s inclusion of several stories about the female companions of the Prophet Muhammad SAW was nothing less than inspirational and revelatory to me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here were women, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> women, not cut-outs or caricatures, embodying their Islam in a myriad of different ways: they were wives and mothers, of course, but they were also scholars and martyrs, warriors and poets, philanthropists and teachers. I was humbled by the story of Khadijah RA’s unwavering loyalty and courage, of Sumayyah RA’s bravery, of Nusaybah RA&#8217;s exploits on the battlefield. These women were heroes, in the traditional sense of the word!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t begin to tell you how much those stories affected me: I was moved, I was awed &#8211; I was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">inspired</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Reading about our predecessors left me confident of a woman’s place in the Ummah and her value in the eyes of Allah SWT. The stories of these complex and fascinating women left an indelible impression on me, one I carry with me to this day. The thought that occurred to me then is still pertinent today: our predecessors were truly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">liberated</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by their Islam. Their strength and courage was not in spite of the deen, but because of it, because of the tawheed, because of their belief in the message and the Messenger </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAW</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in the spirit of our new ‘I’m inspired by&#8230;’ feature, allow me to say this:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am inspired by the legacy of the amazing women who went before me, charting an unmapped course, leaving a legacy for us to follow. Khadijah (RA), Sumayyah (RA), A’ishah (RA), Fatima (RA), Asiya (RA) and Maryam (AS) and so many more – I salute you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am inspired by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">my </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mother and my mother’s mother, by generations of women who stayed strong even when the future looked bleak; women who kept their smiles and their sanity and lived their lives with heads unbowed by oppression or discrimination. My mothers in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Somalia, Nigeria, Palestine, Egypt, Syria – I salute you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am inspired by my amazing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">editors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, past and present, our awesome designers, our wonderful writers and, of course, our beloved readers whose support and words of encouragement inspire us to keep going when times are hard and the workload seems too heavy to bear &#8211; I salute you all.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Islam recognises the ties of kinship in a way that is unparalleled in other religions; it enjoins Muslims to uphold the ties of kinship and condemns the one who breaks them. The Prophet (SAW) said: “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him maintain the bonds of kinship.”<span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Allah (SWT) says:<br />
“Then, is it to be expected of you, if you were put in authority, that you will do mischief in the land, and break your ties of kith and kin? Such are the men whom Allah has cursed for He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Muhammad:22-23)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from the physical needs of food, clothing and shelter, every human being has basic emotional needs. In a cordial family system, the members provide one another with emotional comfort, safety and security and instil feelings of self-esteem and self-worth while allowing room for autonomy and self-discovery. Warm family relationships act as cushions during times of distress and contribute to social cohesion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us, especially converts, have a lot of non-Muslim relatives and the reality for most people is that their relationships with them turn sour after they accept Islam. I was also faced with this phenomenon when I started practising Islam and because most of my relatives &#8211; who were mostly non-Muslims along with a few not-so-conscious Muslims &#8211; did not understand my newly found love for the deen; we gradually began to drift apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realised the enormity of my actions when I learnt that “There is no worse sin for which Allah (SWT) will hasten the punishment of one who commits it in this world in addition to what awaits him in the Hereafter than oppressing others and breaking the ties of kinship.” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Ahmad and Ibn Majah)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realised that I should still be kind to them irrespective of our religious differences or understanding, for the spring of human emotion does not dry up when a person pronounces the Shahadah; rather, our hearts should overflow with love and good treatment towards our relatives, even if they are not Muslims. It then became incumbent upon me to mend the broken ties between me and my relatives – Muslim or non-Muslim &#8211; in tandem with Islamic teachings and in order not to misrepresent Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my sisters who are in similar situations, here are few tips to help you cement your relationship with your relatives and earn the pleasure of Allah (SWT):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e84d4d;"><strong>1 &#8211; Be sincere</strong></span><br />
When you decide to strengthen the shaky bond between you and your relatives, ensure that your ultimate goal is to please Allah (SWT) and do not have expectations of kindness or support from your family. Sometimes, even as you try to get nearer to them, they continue to repel you or do not act well with you; if your intention is solely to please Allah (SWT), it will be easier for you to accept their bad manners in good faith and you will be rewarded, insha Allah!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A man came to the Prophet (SAW) and said, “O Messenger of Allah (SAW), I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off. I treat them well, but they abuse me; I am patient and kind towards them, but they insult me.” The Prophet (SAW) said, “If you are as you say, then it is as if you are putting hot dust in their mouths. Allah will continue to support you as long as you continue to do that.”<span style="color: #999999;"> <em>(Sahih Muslim)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e84d4d;"><strong>Set the boundaries &#8211; in a lovely manner:</strong></span><br />
There is no obedience to the creation in disobedience to the Creator. Considering your religious differences, there would likely be some areas of disagreement with your relatives. For example, you do not eat pork or drink alcohol while they might serve it for dinner. Therefore, you have to let your non-Muslim relatives know that you would not be able to compromise on some things due to the dictates of your religion &#8211; but in a loving manner. Remember “Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching…”<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (An-Nahl:125)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e84d4d;"><strong>2 &#8211; Identify common links</strong></span><br />
Despite your religious differences, there are bound to be values, ideas, family traditions and hobbies which you have in common with your non-Muslim relatives. Try to identify those commonalities and utilise them as points of connection, then transform them into activities that you can engage in together. For example, if you share the hobby of cooking with a relative, you can sample the same recipes, then exchange photos and cooking tips. Do you both love gardening? Then, you can share new gardening knowledge or send her a box of seeds of a species of flower which is uncommon in their locality. Whatever it is, just let them know that you thought of them and care about their interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e84d4d;"><strong>3 &#8211; Exchange gifts</strong></span><br />
The Prophet (SAW) said, “Exchange gifts, for it increases love amongst people” and “Charity given to a poor person is charity, and charity given to a relative earns two rewards: one for giving charity and one for upholding the ties of kinship”. <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Tirmidhi)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, endeavour to send gifts to your relatives occasionally even if you are unable to pay them a visit. This would soften their hearts towards you and increase warmth and affection among you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e84d4d;"><strong>4 &#8211; Pray for them – in their absence</strong></span><br />
Always pray for your relatives, even in their absence, for “the quickest prayer to be answered is a man’s supplication for his brother in his absence” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Bukhari)</em></span>. Remember the case of Abu Hurayra (RA) who went to the Prophet (SAW) to ask him to supplicate that his mother become a Muslim and by the time he got home she had already accepted Islam. Therefore, do not give up on your relatives but constantly pray for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e84d4d;"><strong>5 &#8211; Utilise digital means of communication</strong></span><br />
Advancements in technology have caused a revolution in the way people interact and communicate, with numerous creative and quick ways for keeping in touch. Depending on your schedule, you can send an email or an SMS. You could also join an online social network such as Facebook to keep your relatives updated on your life activities using videos, notes, photos and more. And where distance makes it difficult for you to visit them regularly, you can make a video call using software like Skype. Whichever means is convenient for you, just make sure to keep in touch!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e84d4d;"><strong>6 &#8211; Promote Islam</strong></span><br />
As a Muslim, you are a vicegerent of Allah (SWT) on Earth and therefore the duty of calling to good and forbidding evil falls on you. You can integrate da’wah (inviting others to Islam) with upholding the ties of kinship. Allah the Majestic said:<br />
“And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah and does righteous deeds and says: ‘I am one of the Muslims’.” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Fussilat:33)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you are ‘the Qur’an that they read’ and ‘the Sunnah that they see’; thus you should strive to be a sterling example. There are numerous ways by which you can be a shining example of the beauty of Islam &#8211; perhaps the only example in the life of a beloved one. However, whichever means you adopt, be careful not to impose Islam on your relatives for “there is no compulsion in religion.” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Al-Baqarah:256)</em></span> Show respect for their faith by listening to their views, do not insult or make mockery of their religion or their god lest they do the same to Allah (SWT) or Islam and speak politely even when challenged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, let us all embark on this rewarding and fulfilling venture of strengthening the ties of kinship, masha Allah!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[How symbolic is the colour green in Islam?  J. Samia Mair delves into the depths of Qur’anic ayat and the scientific significanc]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Islam has long been associated with the colour green. Green was our beloved Messenger’s (SAW) favourite colour to wear and he (SAW) was buried in a green Yemeni mantle (<em>see al-Bukhari</em>). Green is mentioned several times in the Qur’an, including in describing the clothes that the believers will wear in Jannah (<em>Al-Kahf:31; Al-Insan:21</em>), gardens therein (<em>Ar-Rahman:64</em>) and the cushions on which believers will lie (<em>Ar-Rahman:76</em>). So, why green? To answer this question, one must first answer the question “what is light?” And to answer that question a little bit of Islamic history is helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ibn al-Haitham, known in the West as Alhazen, was born in Basra, Iraq, around 965 CE and died in Cairo, Egypt, in 1039, where he spent most of his working life. Although he composed almost one hundred works on mathematics, astronomy and optics, he is most famous for his seminal work Kitab al-Manazir or Book of Optics, which is the foundational text for the science of optics and still quoted in academic settings. His work was translated into Latin and heavily influenced Western scientists. Ibn al-Haitham is credited for inventing the first camera (‘qamara’) and revolutionising optics, taking it from a philosophical discussion to one based on scientific inquiry. He used experimental evidence to support his theories, an unusual practice of his day. The Greeks believed that vision occurred through the eyes emitting an invisible light. Ibn al-Haitham, building upon another great Muslim luminary, Al-Kindi (~801-873), showed that vision took place by light reflecting off an object and then entering the eye, setting the groundwork for our understanding of colour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>The Science of Light and Colour</strong></span><br />
The science of light and colour is complicated; it involves wave-particle duality, reflection and refraction, additive and subtractive colour and much more. In very simple terms, though, the sun emits many different types of radiation, one of which is light, which travels through space as electromagnetic waves. Sunlight is composed of all colours but we don&#8217;t see the colours unless something else happens. One process is when white light from an actual source (e.g., sun) is refracted or broken apart as it passes through another medium, such as sunlight through raindrops producing a rainbow. Another is through reflected light, when light from an actual source hits an object. When sunlight hits an object, some of the light may be absorbed and some reflected. An object takes on the colour of the light that is reflected. Thus, something that looks blue reflects more blue light and absorbs other colours, while something that looks yellow reflects more yellow light. A white object reflects all of the light. Something black absorbs all of the light and that is why black isn’t really considered a colour at all but the absence of light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is utterly fascinating (at least I think so) is that nothing has intrinsic colour. An apple isn’t really red; it actually has no colour &#8211; indeed nothing has colour. An apple is only red to us because of three types of cones in our retina that detect different colours (or wavelengths) of light. One type of cone detects long wavelengths (allowing us to perceive reds, oranges and yellows), another type medium wavelengths, (allowing us to perceive greens and yellows) and a third type short wavelengths (allowing us to perceive blues and violets). These 3 cones, known as red, green and blue cones, detect the incoming light and then send electrical signals to our brain, which ultimately settles on a colour. In fact, an average human can see 10 million colours with only these 3 types of cones &#8211; fairly amazing, don’t you think?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Why Green?</strong></span><br />
Of all of the colours in the universe to choose from, why would Islam be associated with the colour green? To answer this question, we turn to the Qur’an. Repeatedly in the Qur’an, Allah (SWT) tells us to look at His signs:<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong><em>We will show them Our Signs in the universe and in their own selves, until it becomes manifest to them that this (the Qur&#8217;an) is the truth. </em></strong></span><em>(Al-Fussilat:53)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the tafsir, Ma’arif ul-Qur’an, it states with respect to Allah’s (SWT) signs in the universe: The word ‘Afaq’ used in the text literally means ‘horizons’ which includes all sides of the whole universe (that is why it is translated above as ‘universe’.) In other words, if one looks at the creatures and creations of the whole universe, big and small, in the skies, on the earth and in between them, they all bear witness not only to the existence of Allah Ta’ala, but also to His Knowledge, His all-encompassing Authority, and to His being One and unique… If a person of even an ordinary intellect ponders over these matters, he is bound to believe that the Creator and Sustainer of all these things is a Being who has limitless Knowledge and Authority, and there simply cannot be anyone like Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, the answer to the question lies in the properties of the green itself. Interestingly, the colour green falls in the middle of the visible spectrum. What better colour to represent Islam, the middle way, a religion of moderation, than the colour green?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><em>In this way We have made you a middlemost community, so that you may act as witnesses against mankind and the Messenger as a witness against you. </em></strong></span><em>(Al-Baqarah:143)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tafsir Al-Qurtubi states: As the Ka’ba is in the middle of the earth, so We made you a middlemost nation, meaning that we made you inferior to the Prophets but superior to other communities. The word “wasat” (middlemost) implies being just and balanced. The basis of this is the expression: “The most praised of things is the middlemost of them.” The middle part of a valley is the best place in it and has the most plants and water. The middle avoids excess and falling short and is praiseworthy, so this community does not go to excess in elevating their Prophet nor fall short as the Jews do in respect of their Prophets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, green lies between yellow and blue on the visible spectrum. Nearly every child knows that if you mix yellow and blue paint together you get green. Symbolically, yellow represents the sun, the heavenly realm, while blue represents earth, the worldly life, and the earth is known as the ‘blue’ planet, as its surface is 70% water. Humans are a blend of heavenly and earthly attributes, just as green is a mixture of yellow and blue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Green is also associated with life, spring and resurrection. Indeed, the Arabic word for ‘paradise’, ‘Jannah’, means ‘garden’, an image universally associated with green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #339966;">And among His Signs (is this), that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water to it, it is stirred to life and growth. Verily, He Who gives it life, surely, (He) is Able to give life to the dead (on the Day of Resurrection). Indeed! He is Able to do all things.</span> </strong>(Al-Fussilat:39)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You probably already know why plants are green &#8211; pigments called chlorophyll found in plant cells. Chlorophyll absorbs certain red and blue light and reflects the green light, giving plants their green hue. The vivid colours of fall &#8211; reds, yellows, oranges, purples &#8211; appear because deciduous plants stop producing chlorophyll as the days begin to shorten, which allows other pigments to dominate. But besides its green colour, chlorophyll is part of a chemical process that converts solar energy into a form that the plant can use as food and, when the plant is eaten, the energy is transferred to that consumer and so on up the food chain. Without chlorophyll, the substance that makes plants green, the sunlight’s energy would be inaccessible to plants, animals and humans as food and life as we know it on earth would cease to exist. The connection of green and life is deep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subhan Allah, nature is an open book for us to read.  What can be more intellectually satisfying than understanding the Divine messages that we are intended to receive? What a blessed way to spend our time, contemplating Allah’s (SWT) signs as we are commanded to do. Undoubtedly, there are other properties of green that explain why it has been chosen to represent Islam. I will leave it to each of us, individually, to ponder those in our noble quest for truth.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[After burying three babies, Umm Nuha reflects on the power of Allah SWT’s promise of ease after difficulty.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I tear up as I lie in bed nursing my almost-2-year-old little girl. Her warm hands stroke my tummy while my arms blanket her as she drifts off to sleep. I knew that weaning her would be difficult for me and now, I find myself turning to Allah, asking Him for the strength to get us both through this weaning process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I imagine that many mothers feel this way about weaning. Many of them have told me that when the time came, they just knew that it was time. That they got to a point when they felt that it was enough. I haven’t reached that point. And I don’t think that I ever will. I have been thinking about this day since the first time that I fed her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As her body relaxes into a deep sleep, I am reminded of my other children. Three of them, who all grew inside me by the permission of Allah, and all three who, by His decree, have returned to Him. And again, I cry. I think of the longing that I had to nourish them with the breastmilk that my body had produced for each one them. The milk that was forced to dry up because my children were stillborn. And yet, I do not wish that things were any different to what they are today. How can I argue with my Lord, whose love for me is greater than my love for my own children?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I began my journey into motherhood, I had no idea that it would take this course. I had read so many books about pregnancy, but no-one wants a pregnant woman to read about stillbirth, let alone think about it, so it wasn’t even on my radar. The very word itself &#8211; stillbirth &#8211; is one that people find difficult to say. No-one expects this to happen to them. Especially when they are young and healthy. Perhaps, I was one of those women who thought that it would never happen to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really wish that I had read an article titled  ‘What to expect when what you were expecting does not happen’. And I wish that everyone I know had read it too. I want everyone to know that I carried my babies for many months. That I felt them kick inside me, that I talked to them, dreamed of them, and longed for them. I want people to know that they were alive at one point &#8211; that Allah had given to each of them a <em>ruh</em> (soul), and then He I took their <em>ruh</em> back to Him. I want people to know that I gave birth to them, and my husband and I held them, and named them. We held our children’s lifeless bodies in our arms and said hello and goodbye all at the same time. And then, my husband had to bury them. The grief was overwhelming and suffocating. I couldn’t see how I would surmount it at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read the following hadith:  The Messenger of Allah SAW said, “When a man’s child dies, Allah, the Exalted, asks His angels, &#8216;Have you taken out the life of the child of My slave?’ and they reply in the affirmative. He SWT then asks, &#8216;Have you taken the fruit of his heart?’ and they reply in the affirmative. Thereupon He asks, &#8216;What did my slave say?’ They say: He praised You and said: <em>Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji’un</em> (We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return).’ Allah says: &#8216;Build a house for my slave in Jannah and name it <em>Baytul-Hamd</em> (the House of Praise).’  Reported by Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I tried to fight my way through the fog that hung over my every thought, I slowly came to realise that I was now part of this special club of bereaved parents who were all hoping to get their reward in the Aakhirah. I often recited Surah Al Inshiraah (The Solace) during all of my pregnancies. I clung to the verses for hope: ‘Verily after hardship comes Ease.  Verily after Hardship comes Ease’. It is a certainty. Such a certainty that Allah SWT says it twice. Each of my children brought their own barakah with them. My husband and I were closer to each other and to Allah as we journeyed through this together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 4 years after I gasped for breath during the silent labour of my firstborn, I was back in labour, but this time, living the promise of Allah. As I heard my fourth child take her first breath, I knew without reservation that Allah’s promise was true. Her name is Yusra. It couldn’t have been anything else really.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My daughter is now the ease in my moments of grief. I am a very different parent to her than what I would have been had I not had her siblings. I try to be more patient, I try not to take a single second for granted. I often find that I am misunderstood by people who label me as an overprotective mother. But the truth is, I am trying to fit the love of 4 children into just one of them, and I am already running out of time. I don’t do it because I feel that I have to. I want to savour every single second. I feed off it. It nourishes me. It makes me feel&#8230;like I can breathe. I don’t want my daughter to grow up in the shadow of my grief, but I do want to her know that she is living proof that Allah SWT does indeed listen to prayers, and that He answers them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time and grief both clarify many things for you. For me, I have to come to realise who my closest friends are &#8211; those who never tire of hearing my story. After parenting Yusra, I can only now imagine the pain that my parents felt at having to watch their daughter go through what I did. But more than anything, what has become clearer than anything else, is that I know that Allah made a promise to me, and He fulfilled it in more ways than I can ever count. And for that, I can never be sufficiently thankful. For that, I will wake up every 2 hours at night to feed my daughter. I will nurse her for the full term that Allah mentions in the Qur’an. I will give thanks for every smile and I will capture it in my mind forever. For every cuddle that I give to her, I will then give her 3 more for each of her siblings. And I will pray to Allah to make them preparers for us for Jannah, and good rewards, and stored treasures, and interceders, and those whose intercessions are accepted.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Maryam Funmilayo explains how her hunt for a small part-time job turned into the opportunity of a lifetime.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am grateful to Allah (SWT) who gives us every opportunity to call upon Him in times of abundance and scarcity. He loves us more when we call on Him for His help, mercy and protection. We will always be in need from the One who is never in need. Can you imagine the number of people who call Him, day in day out, during the twilight of the dawn and in the darkness of the night? They forsake their beds to contemplate, reflect and meditate. Allah (SWT) answers the supplication of every supplicant without His gifts becoming depleted. The more you reach out to Him, the more He loves you and enriches you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All glory belongs to Allah (SWT), who has fashioned me to be a Muslim woman. I thank Allah (SWT) for my Islamic rights, roles, duties and responsibilities. I thank Allah (SWT) that I live in a home where I can exercise my full-fledged rights, as long as the Qur’an and the Sunnah are my guides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Muslim women, we have the choice to work or not to work, depending on our circumstances. We are also encouraged to choose workplaces that are devoid of fitnah, if we decide to work outside our homes. Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal society. This is the stark reality. Otherwise, Muslim women would be seen in every work sector. However, we can make things work for us if we are determined, steadfast and sincere in pleasing Allah (SWT) alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The last time I worked for pay was eight years ago as an undergraduate research assistant in a toxicology lab. My supervisor was a kind hearted Filipino lady, who took the time to train me on the job. As Allah (SWT) would have it, my time there was short lived. I left because I found out I was pregnant with my second child. The Toxicology department had an employee work policy in place; every female employee must report to the supervisor if she becomes pregnant. This was a requirement because a pregnant female employee could be at a high risk if her unborn child was exposed to the chemicals and plant toxins used in the lab. So, I had to say goodbye to my two-month-old job and embrace the homemaking profession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be unfair if I failed to mention that full-time homemakers are always on the move, working day and night. Most of the time, they do not get paid. I always joke about it to some of my friends, who are also homemakers, that our paychecks are going to be given to us when we meet our Lord, insha Allah. Homemaking in itself is an overloaded, full-time, 24/7 job that never ends. However, I had always longed for something extra, besides my job in the house. I wanted to make an impact in my own little way, and I definitely wanted to relish my own, hard-earned money. As you may know, according to the shari’ah law, our husbands’ money is our money, and our money is our money &#8211; not our husbands’. This is one of our basic rights as Muslim women. We need to, and must recognise this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had been searching for a part-time job for quite a long time. So, when I came across a data entry nutrition job opening at one of the universities close to my home, I jumped at the opportunity. Although data entry was not my thing, I still went ahead and applied because of my nutrition background. A few days later, I got a response from one of the hiring managers. She invited me for an interview on Thursday July 19, 2012. I will never forget this day; it was the day I received the August 2012 SISTERS shipment, it was the last day of Sha’ban &#8211; a day before the blessed month of Ramadhan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was interviewed by the hiring manager and the administrative associate. After looking at my resume and asking me various questions about my volunteer work and published articles, the hiring manager told me about another job opportunity called the ‘Faithful Families Eating Smart and Moving More’ program (FFESMM). I had never heard about this program before, and I have been living in this city for over four years. She mentioned that my nutrition skills might be more useful in this program, since my articles focused mainly on health. However, she made mention of something that I would love to share with you, dear reader. She said she knew that there was a large population of the Muslim faith in our county. Yet, it is so unfortunate that our masajid have been missing out on state, private, and NGO health grants. This was because we had no voice, no representative on our behalf to lobby for all these free health grants that could be used to equip our masajid with healthy initiatives. We were visibly absent during any local and state board meetings. This piece of information struck me deeply. There and then, I knew I was at the right place. I did not know what the final outcome of the interview would be, but I felt a strong urge to do something for my community. I had been volunteering for a number of years and enjoyed it with all my heart. Yet, I wanted to do more. I asked myself, how long are we going to be living in a bubble? The non-Muslims are not the only ones affected by chronic and infectious diseases. We are feeling the pains too. Yet, we fail to navigate the health system and assume we are doing okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the time I got home, I was all charged up. I quickly logged on my laptop and googled ‘Faithful Families’. What I found, was unbelievable. Here is a faith-based health education and promotion program developed collaboratively by local universities, public health departments, cooperative extensions and community stakeholders. The goal of the program is to educate and empower every faith community to make healthy choices, through eating healthy foods and staying physically active. This program also allows faith communities to link limited resource families with health education and empower them to adopt healthy eating behaviours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the fourth day of Ramadhan, I went for the second interview. This time around, it was with the program director of the program itself. Both of us connected immediately. We had similar academic experiences and my career dreams were very similar to hers. Her PhD was in Religion and Health, and that got us talking about religions, Islam among them. It was a da’wah style interview in the month of Ramadhan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the twelfth day of Ramadhan, I got a ‘congratulations’ email from the program director. I had been hired as a program assistant and health educator for the FFESMM program. As a program assistant, I would be helping the program director in the marketing and recruitment of participants, scheduling meetings with our Women’s Committee for support, partnering with health organisations and making sure that our masajid are incorporating policy and environmental changes that would enhance the health of its members. I would also be contributing to the FFESMM website, by writing about health activities and classes going on in our masajid. As a health educator, I would be teaching the concepts of nutrition, food resource management, food safety and moderate physical activity, to the Muslim sisters in my community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, what I really loved about this program was the focus on the connection between food, health and faith. Therefore, as a FFESMM health educator, I must teach these nutrition classes, incorporating the Qur’an and Sunnah. I must encourage my sisters to think deeply, realise, and acknowledge how their physical health is connected to the faith they live out daily. I find this work both amazing and intriguing. This job also allows me to choose my hours, and I even get paid for reading anything related to Faithful Families, be it journal articles on faith and health, public speaking skills and marketing strategies. This job has forced me to leave my comfort zone by turning me into a public speaker. I used to freak out when called to speak in public, even to women-only gatherings. In the western world, Muslims have to learn the art of public speaking for da’wah purposes and for other educational benefits. Surely, this is a blessing from Allah (SWT). I have to recruit participants and tell them about the FFESMM program, to reach out to them if they do not reach out to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To say I am deeply fulfilled, pleased and satisfied is an understatement. I have been calling upon my Lord for a long time, asking him to bless me with a flexible, family-friendly, part-time job. He has answered my du’a. I know Allah (SWT) chose me for this position because He wanted me to make an impact and help improve people’s lives. He presented this job to me when He knew the time was right for me to take up an additional task, besides my homely duties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in my second month at work, I feel the contentment and enjoyment. I love the fact that it connects me with my own Muslim community, specifically the Muslim sisters. I love the fact that the Qur’an and ahadeeth are part of our educational resources in the classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thank Allah (SWT) for my Ramadhan gift. It is, indeed, an answered du’a.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A nocturnal chance to give charity became an inspiring experience for Sadaf Farooqi and her family.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late one night this past Ramadhan, as my family and I were returning home, a sudden thought struck me and I said to my husband, “Please keep a look-out and see if you can spot someone who looks needy, because I think I will give some of my zakah right now, if possible.” It was within a few seconds that we spotted a barely visible figure alone in the darkness, rummaging through the garbage dumpsters on the main road in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to say that it has been my routine, over the past few years, to try and seek needy people on the streets to give chunks of my zakah to, directly. Living in a country &#8211; Pakistan &#8211; where most of the population lives below the poverty line and leads a hand-to-mouth existence barely making ends meet, the giving hand doesn’t have to look far to find an eagerly receiving one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different Muslims have different approaches towards discharging their yearly obligatory charity, depending on their location and circumstances. Many avail the services of organisations that have proved their trustworthiness over time, to which they hand over their zakah in order for it to reach poor, hungry, homeless, sick, afflicted or indebted Muslims, perhaps on a global scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many Muslims, giving zakah is a one-time action of handing over a lump of cash, or a cheque, to a person behind a desk and receiving a receipt for it. For others, it involves a few clicks on the computer. The eventual recipient of their money is hardly ever seen, let alone met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is an unparalleled joy in giving a truly deserving Muslim zakah with your own hand and witnessing the effect of that charity on them right there and then!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming back to the figure moving around among the dumpsters, it was a young, dishevelled-looking man. I asked my husband to stop the car and ask him if he was a Muslim and I handed him the money to be donated if he was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A brief conversation ensued between the two, during which I was surprised to witness, through the car’s rear-view mirror, the man actually trying to touch my husband’s feet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On returning to the car, my husband looked visibly affected as he said, “You really helped someone truly deserving tonight!” He told me that as soon as the man saw the money and realised that someone was donating it to him, his face lit up with unbridled euphoria, and emotionally-charged dua’s starting pouring from his lips as he impulsively bent down to touch his helper’s feet. He then went on to explain how someone had swindled him, telling him that he’d get him a job in the sprawling cosmopolitan city of Karachi, thus convincing him to get on a bus from his hometown up North in the country. On arriving in the sea port, he was stripped of all his money and belongings and left homeless, leading him to search for food in dumpsters as he knew no one in the city. He said he would use some of the money to buy a bus or railway ticket back home. The dua’s didn’t stop pouring from his lips until my husband drove away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night I felt like Allah (SWT) had blessed me with His special mercy and truly answered my prayers, because I had beseeched Him to make my zakah reach genuinely deserving recipients and that He accept it all from me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is for this &#8211; experiencing the true joy of giving &#8211; that I try to give a portion of charity every year personally, by seeking out random needy people that I spot doing menial jobs on the streets; their acute neediness being apparent from their health, facial expression and demeanour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, it does happen that when you’re looking for brass, you strike gold!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Sadaf Farooqi is grateful for living in a country where she repeatedly gets opportunities to seek out genuinely needy people and feel the spiritual rush of helping ease their misery. </em></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Zainab bint Younus shares the stories of two women who held the Prophet’s promise of Paradise close to their hearts.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman’s love is deep and runs strong; it’s tender and fierce and sometimes needs no more than an instant to establish a bond that stretches beyond time, beyond space. A woman’s love can result in an angel being sent from heaven to reveal a miraculous well; in her name being mentioned in the greatest of all Divine Scriptures; in the power to defy a tyrant king before his people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A woman’s love is powerful and a Muslim woman’s love for her Lord and His Messenger, Muhammad (SAW), can make her the most powerful human being amongst mankind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rasul Allah (SAW) knew this, respected it and praised it. His love for the women of his Ummah did not stop at his wives and daughters, but extended to those who struggled, fought and died for the message he taught.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Martyr for the Beloved</strong><br />
Sumayyah bint Khayyat, Umm ‘Ammar, was the first to die for the sake of Islam. She and her family were slaves who had accepted Islam and, when their masters discovered their acceptance of the faith, they tortured Sumayyah, her husband and her son. Every day that they were dragged out to the desert and tormented, Sumayyah faced the very worst of it. Abu Jahl and his companions raped her repeatedly with hot metal instruments, which eventually led to her death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rasul Allah would sometimes pass by and see what was being done to Sumayyah and her family &#8211; what they went through for the sake of his message. His eyes overflowing with tears, he prayed, “Have patience, O family of Yaasir! Verily, your meeting place will be in Paradise.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her heart burning with love for Allah and His Messenger, Sumayyah would answer, “I testify that you are the Messenger of Allah and that your promise is truthful.” Soon after, she died as a martyr and the first woman to be guaranteed Jannah by Rasul Allah (SAW).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A woman’s love does not need flattery or trinkets to keep it alive; it needs the Truth. Sumayyah had never lived with the Prophet r in his household; it was likely that she saw him or heard from him directly only a few times. She did not even need physical proximity to create love for him in her heart; it was enough for her that he was the Messenger of Allah, who had brought the message of truth that guided her to her Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Warrior’s Spirit</strong><br />
Umm ‘Imarah al-Ansariyyah was another sahabiyyah whose love for Rasul Allah (SAW) resulted in a unique relationship that has been immortalised in the seerah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially a nurse, Umm ‘Imarah was present at the battlefield of Uhud when the rumour began to spread that Rasul Allah had been killed. Amidst the fleeing of Muslim soldiers, Umm ‘Imarah lifted her sword and sought out the Prophet (SAW) for herself. When she found him, she placed herself firmly in front of him and began to defend him with a strength and courage to rival that of the male companions. The power of her love was such that when her son was gravely injured, she didn’t even stop until Rasul Allah (SAW) told her to attend to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“From where can anyone get courage like you, O Umm &#8216;Imarah?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is narrated that the Prophet said that in whichever direction he turned in the battlefield, he could see her defending and protecting him. Admiring the ferocity of her devotion, Rasul Allah invoked Allah&#8217;s blessings on Umm ‘Imarah’s family and prayed that they should be his friends in Paradise as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Battle of Uhud, Umm ‘Imarah wielded her sword on the battlefields of Yamamah and Hunayn and was present at the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. She also took part in the second pledge of ‘Aqabah. However, Umm ‘Imarah’s relationship with the Messenger of Allah was not restricted to the battlefield. It is also due to her questioning that the famous verse of Surah al-Ahzab, verse 35, was revealed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Umm ‘Imarah al-Ansariyyah said that she went to the Prophet (SAW) and said to him: &#8220;I feel that everything is for men. Women are not mentioned as having anything!” Verse 35 of Surah al-Ahzab was then sent down. <em>(The Hadith is narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3211, and is in Sahih at-Tirmidhi under No. 2565)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These stories are examples of how Rasul Allah interacted with the women of his Ummah, inspiring their love for him and their dedication to Islam. His dealings with the sahabiyyat were full of dignity and respect, acknowledging their sacrifices and their talents. He valued them as much as any male companion and never, for a moment, doubted their sincerity or their worth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In turn, the sahabiyyat loved him fiercely. Not as a husband or a father, but as the Messenger of Allah: the person who had brought them the message of Islam, the truth that purified their souls, the only path that would lead them to their Lord and Creator. It was Muhammad r who taught them about Allah, who told them about Paradise and its beauty and its reward, who warned them against Hell and its torments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was for the sake of Allah and His Messenger that the sahabiyyat transformed their lives and sacrificed their health and wealth, dedicating their lives to the promise delivered by Rasul Allah (SAW):</p>
<p><strong><em>Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so &#8211; for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward. </em></strong><em>(Al-Ahzab:35)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Zainab bint Younus describes a significant point in the life of Umayyah bint Qays (RA). This touching story will cause us to asses]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A girl’s first period is a major turning point in her life – the moment she crosses the threshold from childhood into adulthood, the moment she becomes a woman. It is a time fraught with anxiety and, often, with a sense of shame. Mothers and older sisters are the first to be told when a girl begins her first period; menstruation is a “woman’s secret” and men are expected to be kept deliberately ignorant of its details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many cultures, girls are scolded for letting slip any hints about their menses to the menfolk of the household, who often remain blithely oblivious to the maturation of their daughters and sisters. Should a situation arise wherein the subject comes up, the male reaction is usually one of mortification, irritation and a gruff change of topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet this awkward, complicated relationship between young girls and the menfolk around them doesn’t need to exist. In fact, shocking as it may seem, a different type of relationship entirely could exist – one of compassion, sensitivity, gentleness and understanding not only between girls and their immediate male relatives, but, in fact, between the unrelated men and women of the Ummah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof for this lies in the seerah itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Umayyah bint Qays (RA) was a young girl who had not yet reached puberty, who joined the Muslim army on its way to Khaybar. Rasul Allah (SAW) had her sit on his she-camel, just behind his luggage and they rode for some time. When they paused for a reprieve, Rasul Allah (SAW) descended and had his camel kneel down, whereupon Umayyah got off as well. To her mortification, she noticed that the luggage she&#8217;d been sitting on was smeared with blood &#8211; her first period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Umayyah sat back on the bag, leaning forward to try and hide the blood stain, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rasul Allah (SAW) &#8211; ever keen, ever kind &#8211; noticed both her actions and the bloodstain and said gently, &#8220;perhaps this is menstrual blood?&#8221; Umayyah nodded in confirmation and Rasul Allah (SAW) suggested kindly, &#8220;attend to yourself, then take some water, put some salt in it and wash the bag, then return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Umayyah followed his instructions and was once again seated upon Rasul Allah&#8217;s camel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Muslims were victorious at Khaybar, Rasul Allah (SAW) chose a necklace from amongst the spoils of war and summoned Umayyah, then placed it around her neck with his own hands. She wore that necklace until she died.<em> (Al-Muhaddithat; al-Tabaqat al-Kubra by Ibn Sa&#8217;d.)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SubhanAllah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Umayyah was what we would think of as a &#8216;tween&#8217; today &#8211; a young girl straddling the line between childhood and womanhood. Whereas most girls of that age today are pushed away by their fathers and brothers to &#8220;go be with the women&#8221;, Rasul Allah (SAW) fondly had her accompany him on his own camel. Considering that even the great men of the Sahabah vied to be in Rasul Allah&#8217;s presence and thought of it as a great honour, this shows how much Rasul Allah (SAW) valued every member of his Ummah &#8211; male and female, young and old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you imagine how thrilled Umayyah must have been to be given this honour, how confident she must have felt at being chosen to ride with the Messenger of Allah (SAW) himself? Every young girl wants to feel special and valued and what better way to make this young believer love Allah and His Messenger than to choose her out of the throngs of adults who made up Rasul Allah&#8217;s closest advisers and warriors?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gentle, compassionate and respectful relationship that Rasul Allah displayed with this young member of his Ummah was also emulated by his sahabah (RA). Abu ad-Dardaa’ (RA) used to be the guardian of an orphan girl and he would bring her to pray with him amongst the men, wrapping her in his own cloak. When she attained puberty, he gently sent her to pray with the women, but continued to look after her carefully. She later became known as Umm ad-Dardaa’ as-Sughraa and one of the great scholars of the Tabi’een.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) A girl&#8217;s first period is a major turning point of her life. In many cultures, it is treated with shame and embarrassment, made to seem as though it is something evil or unfortunate &#8211; something to be hidden amongst women and kept a secret from men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine how mortified Umayyah was &#8211; not only had she just started her first period, but she wasn&#8217;t even with her mother or other women. In fact, she wasn&#8217;t even with a male family member! She was with the Messenger of Allah (SAW) and her menstrual blood had stained his luggage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Rasul Allah (SAW) was like many other men, he could have gotten angry and upset or shooed her away and made her feel ashamed for what had happened. Instead, he was soft, gentle and understanding; he didn&#8217;t blame her for anything, didn&#8217;t demand angrily &#8220;What have you done?! What is this mess?!&#8221; He didn&#8217;t even ask her for an explanation; he provided one for her and was incredibly sweet about it. In fact, he gave her simple, practical advice on what to do and actually told her to return to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) After the expedition of Khaybar was over and the Muslims had won the battle, Rasul Allah (SAW) didn&#8217;t simply forget Umayyah and never think of her again. On the contrary, he hand-picked jewellery for her, brought her forward to him again and gave her the necklace himself. What better way to warm her heart and remind her of an experience that could have been a source of lifelong embarrassment, but was instead one of the most wonderful events of her life?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rasul Allah&#8217;s behaviour with this young girl holds so many lessons for Muslim men on how they should deal with their sisters, daughters and, in fact, any young girl at all, whether she is related to them or not. His actions are an example of how every girl should be honoured and treasured as valued members of this Ummah. Rasul Allah (SAW) and his sahabah (RA), such as Abu ad-Dardaa’, displayed how a relationship of compassion, gentleness, respect and dignity between men and women, and boys and girls, is possible and, indeed, necessary. Considering the current state of gender relations in the Muslim Ummah – whether it be extreme, harsh segregation or unhealthily close relationships, the balanced, positive example of Rasul Allah (SAW) is one that we must follow. In fact, it can be said that acting upon this sunnah is imperative for the psychological health of the Ummah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Muslims, we should endeavor to create a safe and healthy environment in which even a young pubescent girl in a sensitive or difficult situation can feel comfortable enough to turn to her brother in Islam – even if he is an unrelated male or older than her in age – and trust that he will care for her with the compassion, respect and dignity owed to any fellow Muslim, whether male or female.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The honour and dignity of Muslim men and women, which they hold within themselves and accord to each other, is something that is unique to the Ummah of Rasul Allah (SAW). Although many Muslims appear to have forgotten about it, preferring flawed cultural notions of ‘honour’ instead, it is up to us to reclaim this beautiful aspect of our Deen and follow in the footsteps of the heroes and heroines of Islam.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Rachel Twort explains the benefits of reflective cycles when analysing your experiences.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong>A believer is not bitten from the same hole twice.</strong> </span>(Bukhari/ Muslim)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all have our snakes in the grass, waiting to slither across our path and stop us in our tracks. I seem to keep wandering into the same abysses again and again. Sometimes I seek excuses for myself, like it is better to be victim than aggressor. But really it is my failure to learn that has led me back into the hole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how can we stop history repeating itself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong>Being aware</strong></span><br />
Do we stop to reflect on our experiences? Muhasaba, or taking account of oneself, is an important act for a Muslim. It can reveal the patterns we fall into that we may be unaware of if we do not break routine to think. If we are on the alert for the trap, we should be less likely to stumble into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to quit using the Sudoku app on my phone to wind down before sleep and replace it with quiet reflective time. As an app addict, I use Athan from Islamic Finder to track my prayers and my diary to review goals. Others use Facebook and blogging to form reflections. However, the public nature of these tools can limit the level of analysis and revelation. Also, as they are public, they should offer something of interest and benefit to the reader. I do love a good bit of stationery and so find the Siratt Lifebook a useful tool for checking and setting goals; they also do a journal. Productivemuslim.com has some useful tools too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reflection is a process that has stages. The stages help lead us to identifying and making the necessary changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong>1. Being detached</strong></span><br />
The rush of emotions attached to an experience can prevent us from seeing the wood for the trees. It is useful to name the experience; state the facts, the bare bones of what happened. Acknowledge the heat of feeling and let it pass. Move onto listing or naming the concrete facts. This tool can help stop runaway thoughts, such as fear and anger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong>2. Evaluate and analyse your experience</strong></span><br />
The next step is to get to the bottom of how and why the situation occurred. To do this, we need to step outside of the situation. There are a number of lenses that offer a different view: our past experience, other people’s perspectives and the religious perspective. Together these lenses can tell us who we are and what really happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Our past experiences shape us and our approach to experiences.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, our past experiences have given us the tools to understand our current situation. Sometimes, however, they can become millstones around our necks, dragging us below the waves. In the current situation, have we become victim to a learnt pattern, assumption or emotional response? In this case, we need to be open to seeing our situation through fresh eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Taking advice from others offers another perspective.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong><em>The believer is the mirror of the believer.</em></strong> </span><em>(Abu Dawud)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our sisters may be able to see our mistakes and shortcomings more objectively that we can. Being open to sincere advice is a great and hard-to-achieve virtue. In conflict situations, it is very useful to imagine the scenario from the other person’s point of view &#8211; without making assumptions about their experience, of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Qur’an and sunnah offer us the ultimate check on moral correctitude. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other people’s advice needs to be checked against the ultimate Criterion – the Qur’an and Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad r. The Qur’an and the Hadith offer us insight and advice for all the situations we may find ourselves in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #79b8c9;"> <strong>3. Make an action plan</strong></span><br />
We now know how we feel, what happened and why it happened, but let’s not leave it there. What are we going to do now? We need to make a plan of action so we are ready for the next time the snake creeps out of the hole. How can we do things differently next time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong>4. Breaking the pattern </strong></span><br />
When it sneaks out from that hole again, swing the axe and cut its toothy head off! But you know it’s not that easy. Whatever experience you have wrestling the monster, you will need to reflect, learn new lessons and devise an action plan. Let the Reflective Cycle begin again…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong>5. The cycle begins again…</strong></span><br />
This cycle of muhasaba could be summarised as the ‘what? so what? now what?’ approach. This is a model of reflective thinking used by educators and other professionals to encourage learning from experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong>REFLECTIVE THINKING IN ACTION</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #79b8c9;"> <em><strong>What happened?</strong></em></span><br />
Robina was at a circle in the mosque with her four young children. The children were very active and noisy, clearly disturbing other attendees. Another sister sternly told one of Robina’s children off and told him to sit down and be quiet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong><em>What were your feelings or reactions?</em></strong></span><br />
Robina was mortified. She was highly annoyed with the approach of the sister. It made her feel judged and inadequate and also guilty for disturbing others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><em><strong>What was good or bad about the experience?</strong></em></span><br />
The feelings evoked were negative and it made her want to stop attending the circle. On the positive, she realised the boundaries and expectations in the mosque were different to her own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><em><strong>What do the lenses of other people’s perception and religious perspective tell you?</strong></em></span><br />
The other sister may have felt differently about the bringing up of children. She may have felt that she had more of a stake and a role in Robina’s child’s disciplining. She may have spoken to the child out of a sense of communal ownership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><strong><em>What can be concluded from the experience?</em></strong></span><br />
The children need to behave within certain boundaries when they attend a circle. Robina does not like other people disciplining her children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #79b8c9;"><em><strong>What do you want to do next time?</strong></em></span><br />
Robina decided to make the boundaries of the mosque clear to her children and to remove them from the situation if their behaviour became too boisterous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robina also decided that she did not want other people to feel they could scold her children. At the beginning of the next circle she explained to the other sisters that she had no childcare and really wanted to benefit from attending the circle. She asked that if anyone felt that any issue regarding her children’s behaviour needed to be addressed they should speak to her and she would deal with it herself.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Safia A. reflects on the beautifully inspirational life of her grandmother.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What can I, a 21st century woman, possibly have to learn from a woman who never studied past the 8th grade, never held a job, and barely travelled? As it turns out, quite a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first and most enduring memory of my Nani &#8211; my maternal grandmother &#8211; is a beautiful picture in my head. She is sitting serenely on the sofa in her lounge as we arrive from the airport, tired and longing for a shower. She has a table in front of her, a colander full of vegetables in it, and a peeler in her hand. Her thin white hair is tied in a plait which snakes down her permanently bent back (when she walked, it remained parallel to the ground). Her eyes light up as we enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nani was never one to dish out cuddles, hugs and kisses left right and centre. Touchy feely was not her thing. But the kindness in her heart was unmistakable, if you cared to look. Mother to ten children (though one died in infancy), and each one ready to lay down his or her life for her – she was the flame to her moths. They knew only too well how much she had suffered, how great her struggles had been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While still young, she had married a man who was highly educated and too intelligent for his own good. It was an arranged marriage and love never blossomed – he had married beneath him, and he never let himself forget it. What could a man who had travelled to the USA for further education possibly have in common with a woman who had never even finished her schooling?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the partition, when Pakistan came into being, they moved to the new and promised land under harrowing conditions. She saw Sikh men with swords enter the train and butcher all the Muslims on board. They only managed to survive by hiding beneath a corpse and pretending to be dead. In Pakistan, she quickly had to learn how to manage life with a growing family, and her deteriorating health. Though she was young, she suffered the most incapacitating pain which left her immobile for minutes at a time. Relief finally came when a doctor suggested she have all her teeth removed; miraculously it worked, though I am sure the decision could not have been an easy one for a young woman in her twenties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The political turmoil in Pakistan meant that my grandfather, a man of strict principles, was threatened with the loss of his job unless he did the bidding of the corrupt establishment, and finally that threat came to pass. With a wife and nine children to support, one can only imagine how they survived. By this time, Nani’s health had worsened, and she now had a permanent stoop. But even with their meagre resources, they managed to feed, educate and have all their children married – no mean feat. Nani often told me how she had helped her middle daughter get married – clothes, wedding feast, the works – with just 200 Rupees to spend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What really touches my heart is her treatment of her servant boy. He is now a man with children of his own, but when he first came to her, he was just a child from the wrong side of town. She taught him how to read the Qur’an and raised him under the guiding principles of Islam, filling his heart with love for Allah (SWT) and His Prophet (SAW). She taught him to read and write Urdu, so he could study the newspaper and wake up to the wider world around him. She taught him maths so he could balance his own books when the time came. When he grew too old to be around young girls in the house, she had him moved to my uncle’s workshop in the city, where he ran errands and helped out with administration duties. When he discovered his wings, she did not hold him back, but encouraged him to leave the nest and find his own way in the world. He never forgot what she had done for him, and to this day he visits with his family, and refers to her as his mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her daughter-in-law once told me that she didn’t miss her own parents anymore, because Nani had filled her heart with more love than she had ever known. That is testimony indeed of her greatness. I spent nearly every summer in her house, and heard many fascinating stories of her childhood, of a place and time that is totally foreign to me. She taught me how to crochet and sew, but more importantly, she taught me the true meaning of patience and kindness. When I was pregnant with my first child, and thoroughly ill, she couldn’t bear to see me suffer; she stayed up all night rubbing my back though she was even more ill than I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my grandfather became paralysed, she showed him the true meaning of devotion. Turning a blind eye to the years of ill-treatment she had received from him, Nani prepared his meals as he liked them, and fed him with her own hands. His growing senility and loss of memory allowed them to make a fresh start, and he insisted that she be the only one to feed him. He would get worked up if he hadn’t seen her for a few hours, and felt at peace when she entered his room. Of all the years they spent together, perhaps these were the happiest of her life. When he passed away quietly in bed one afternoon, she was genuinely heartbroken. Life seemed to drain out of her. Her illnesses overtook her, and as soon as her iddat was over, she left this world to join him, insha Allah in a happiness and love that will endure for eternity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though she lived in another country and I only ever spent my summers with her, I loved my Nani and miss her greatly. Her funeral is proof of the esteem she was held in by everyone who knew her – there was not one dry eye in the house. Every servant, every daughter-in-law, every neighbour was sobbing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Nani was very close to Allah (SWT) – a simple, humble woman who gave everything away to others, who had no need for any fineries and luxuries, and who devoted every day to looking after her family and worshipping the one God. Of all worldly things, the only one she prized was good health – “If you have your health, you have the universe,” she often used to say. She was never distracted by dunya, never took her eye off the ball. Many people have told me that they have seen her in their dreams, and she is always wearing bright white robes, sitting on a field green and lush as far as the eye can see, with pearl slippers on her feet. Most importantly, she has a smile on her face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Alhamdulillah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Wardah Abbas paints a vivid picture of the transience of life, recalling her own personal experience and telling us why we should ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I became a sophomore at the end of 2009 in Hijra 1430, I was on top of the universe. I had lots of thoughts gaining free entry and exit in and out of my mind. I wanted to be bigger, prettier and more respected. The whole idea of remaining the same “Wardah” I was in my first year began to freak me out as I desperately yearned for a change. I thought of nothing other than how to change my wardrobe, get a new phone and buy new shoes, bags, jewellery and expensive make-up kits. I wanted a sophisticated laptop for the sophisticated second year law student I was about to become and of course I got my father to increase my monthly stipend. I would sit on the balcony of my parents’ little house and create a vision of myself getting attention from all corners of the faculty and becoming popular. These were beautiful dreams that were too much for the taste buds in my mind to savour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each new day found me sinking into my deep sea of crazy thoughts but I never tired of it. I became discontented with whatever I was given by my poor parents. I found a new “Wardah” that never ceased to ask for more. It went on and on until the day came, one of the sunniest days ever, when my father took my elder brother and I with him on a trip to Lagos. It was our tradition to invoke Allah (SWT) before and after embarking on any journey; that day was no  exception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We toured all the places my father intended for us and, by the grace of Allah (SWT), we took off on another long journey back home. My elder brother was sitting next to my father in the front seat, both lost in a conversation that just seemed boring to me. I began to feel alone. My crazy thoughts were not sufficient to keep me company, giving way to the cool breeze that found its way through the window to pamper my eyes. My eyes became heavy after a while and, before I knew it, my tired body was lying flat on the back seat of the car, fast asleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn’t know just how long I had slept. I only remember waking up to find myself on the floor of the car. I was unaware of what had woken me but I thought I must have been  in such a deep sleep that I didn’t know how and when I fell from the seat to the floor. Then I made attempts to get up, but I kept failing. I tried so hard until my efforts were interrupted by the voice of my elder brother crying out to me, “Wardah, please open the back door.” Even at that moment, I was still oblivious of the events that surrounded me. My mind was empty, my body seemed lifeless and my brain inactive. I just lay there, staring into nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a great deal of force in his weakest physical state, my brother managed to get himself to the back to open the door and, as he did that, it became easy for me to get up from where I lay. The sight that stared me in the face was a very terrible one. Both my father and my elder brother were soaked in a pool of blood and the car badly damaged beyond reasonable recognition. A very fast shiver ran down my spine and, like a robot, I had no tears. I just remained speechless and numb. At that moment, it dawned on me that we had been involved in a terrible accident. But to my utmost disbelief, I was still as healthy as ever. No injuries, no sprains and no cramps. I just couldn’t figure out how.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hours that followed found us in a nearby first aid clinic at Sagamu in Ogun State where the accident occurred. My father and my elder brother were both receiving medical attention while some of the nurses stared at me with eyes filled with awe. They just couldn’t comprehend how I had escaped that terrible accident without the slightest pain or injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my uncles was soon contacted and, after some time, he came in the company of his wife to pick us up. While we journeyed back home, I was carried away by a series of assembled thoughts which flowed in and out of my wide open mind. There were too many questions that my blank brain just couldn’t provide answers to. Questions like “What if they hadn’t worn seatbelts? Would they have returned to Allah (SWT)?”  “What if I hadn’t lain on the back seat? Wouldn’t I have been injured beyond reasonable repair?” “What if we had all died? How would our family feel?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new vision of me found its way through my weak brain as I began to imagine myself without either hands or legs or even my sense of sight. I then drifted to assuming myself dead. How would it happen? Where would I go and what was I going to experience in my grave? I was shaken by these thoughts. The experience I had gained in that short time had a lifelong effect and taught me that only a thin line separated life from death. My mind was too weak to accommodate the hundreds of thoughts running in and out and there was no better way to get rid of them at that moment than to allow the tears flow. For the first time since the occurrence, I cried. If the accident had ended my life, would that have ended all my dreams of being a respectable justice, a very wealthy and popular figure, the best wife for a fabulous husband and a cute mother for the loveliest kids? What was going to happen to that beauty which many admired? Would the memories continue to live and grow in the hearts of those who knew me? No question seemed to come with a full stop. The more they came, the heavier my heart became.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the burden of my thoughts lightened when the car halted in the parking lot of the casualty section of the University College Hospital of the University of Ibadan. Almost immediately, the nurses got my father and my elder brother wheeled in. I had to stay with them in the hospital till the next day when my mother was brought down there in her weakest emotional state. The hours I spent in the hospital were  filled with terror. The things I saw were so frightening that I could never forget them in my entire life. I began to shiver when the fear of Allah (SWT) gripped me. The sight of patients whose conditions were worse than ours &#8211; patients who, in the course of their own accidents, had lost their sight and spinal cords, some who had even lost their minds after the the deadly event. Some patients had arms and legs that had to be amputated. There was blood everywhere and the majority had to be wheeled into the mortuary having answered Allah’s call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an eye opener &#8211; a dreadful experience and the basis of a reminiscence I will cherish for the rest of my short and vulnerable life. I felt ashamed of myself as I kept thanking Allah (SWT) for his mercies that I never asked for. I asked for Allah’s forgiveness for being the foolish, ungrateful whiner I was. I had closed my mind to the fact that each movement I made with every part of my body would not have been possible without the leave of Allah (SWT). I had a lot to thank Him endlessly for, but my love for all the good things of this world made them fall off my radar. All my dreams were directed towards things of this transient world when I had the abandoned choice of living my whole life in service to my Creator. And, until that very tragic occurrence, I had been lost in thoughts of how to upgrade my social status as a sophomore in school. What an idea for a loser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The car accident was a gift. It was evidence of Allah’s sincere love for me. I knew I needed a revival &#8211; rebirth. I needed to adopt a new life as a stranger. I decided to redirect my path in life. I resolved to submit myself to the total Will of Almighty Allah and accept all that He has decreed. I prayed fervently to Him to help me regain my nearness to Him and this has helped me strengthen my faith in Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the satisfaction and peace I get from my revival is a treasure I will cling to for the rest of my life. I am no longer anxious of what will happen tomorrow as it has already been decreed by Allah. I am now inclined to live like I will be no more tomorrow because for every life has a definite end and verily, “from Allah we come and to Him we shall return”.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Khadijah Stott-Andrew reflects on how the character of Khadijah Bint Khuwaylid (RA) has been a constant guidance throughout her ma]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I put pen to paper, I contemplate the reasons why I feel honoured to be called Khadijah. Although, I was not always sensible of this honour; unlike most reverts, I was fairly young when I chose my Muslim name. Only just hitting double figures, I picked the first name that “sounded pretty”. My Mum became Muslim when I was just 8 years old, and I followed along with my mind until my heart embraced the deen completely, when I was 14. At this point, I had been known as Khadijah by everyone around me since I had started secondary school. Yet, there were times when reading about ‘A’isha’s feisty, yet playful attitude, that I wished I hadn’t been so hasty in my name choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, 2007 brought a nasheed into my path &#8211; a nasheed that divulged the true beauty around the Prophet Muhammad’s marriage to Khadijah Bint Khuwaylid (RA). The words of this nasheed touched my heart in a way I never thought possible, with its lyrics describing the strength of Khadijah and the unwavering loyalty that bonded her with the Prophet Muhammad (SAW). It explained the respect, love and understanding that existed between them and made their marriage one of the most inspiring love stories I’ve ever heard. Hearing this nasheed motivated me to purchase books, look up articles and search hadiths, as I was desperate to learn more about their beautiful marriage. Putting Romeo and Juliet to shame, I have always seen Khadijah’s marriage to Muhammad (SAW) as one of the most exquisite partnerships in history, and I struggle to discuss the beauty and tenderness behind their relationship without tears filling my eyes and a lump forming in my throat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) stumbled home, trembling in fear and confusion, Khadijah (RA) comforted and reassured him. But not stopping there, Khadijah (RA) delivered constructive, practical assistance and accompanied her husband to visit Waraqah, to allow Muhammad (SAW) to gain further clarity on his experience. She became the wife he inspired her to be, and her companionship and support enabled him to continue being the epitome of   perfection for all future mankind. When Allah (SWT) decided it was time for Khadijah to return to Him, the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) felt utterly helpless and did all he could to comfort her. Without leaving her side, he stroked her head, whilst reminding her of all the blissful promises Allah (SWT) had delivered and soothed her fears by articulating the beautiful, eternal tranquility that awaited her. Their marriage, love and loyalty meant so much, that years after her death, when he had many other wives, armies to command and a city to govern, his eyes filled with mournful tears and his heart ached when he found an old piece of jewellery belonging to his beloved Khadijah (RA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing all of this, I yearned to support and comfort my spouse the way Khadijah had. In 2009, I was granted this opportunity when I met my husband. A strong man in both deen and character, he appeared to need little assistance and consistently supports our family financially, and he always takes the time to help me nurture my iman and help me achieve my goals. It took me a while to realise that, no matter how strong and independent a man appears to be, his job is always easier with a supportive wife who is contributing to the family &#8211; that is what makes it a partnership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, an idea was proposed by my husband which tested my intention to simulate Khadijah’s trust and understanding, “What do you think about me teaching abroad?” he asked, “There are more opportunities than here. Especially for us, as a family.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The suggestion caught me off guard &#8211; move abroad? Away from my friends and family? A panic and fear of the unknown coursed through my veins, and I mumbled a few lukewarm positives about our current country of residence, quickly trying to formulate a plan to somehow discourage this idea. However, mid-thought, a small voice in my mind challenged me, “What would Khadijah do?” This stopped me in my tracks, and I contemplated the wondrous manner with which Khadijah put her trust in her husband’s judgement and ability to do the best for her and the children. Not only this, but she would provide her services in any way possible, in order to lighten the load on her husband’s shoulders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My attitude quickly changed, and I now assist my husband in researching the possible places abroad and asking opinions of people who live there. Me and my husband now bond whilst discussing the possibilities and developing action plans for our family’s future; now, it really feels like a partnership. I find myself wondering on a daily basis, “What would Khadijah do?” So, by advising and comforting, or practically lending a hand, I do my best to stand equal at my husband’s side as we work together to raise our family. Whether it is arranging business ideas, helping with lesson plans, or even something simple, like baking his favourite cake, I try my best to make him smile. All the while, Khadijah’s memory motivates me, encouraging me in this endeavour &#8211; which is not always the easiest of tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I now wonder what my marriage would be like if I dug my heels in the ground, resisting all proposals I disliked and striving to mould my husband to my liking, demanding my rights with misguided self-importance. It doesn’t paint a pretty picture &#8211; certainly not the kind of marriage I wish to have. Submitting to my husband is easy when I have a practising Muslim husband, who fears Allah (SWT) and adheres to  the Sunnah. Plus, he always returns the favour, increasing the love and compassion between us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I choose Khadijah’s path. Through the grace and guidance of Allah (SWT), the example of Khadijah Bint Khuwaylid (RA) has kept my marriage strong and happy. For, where would the Ummah be if Allah (SWT) had not blessed Muhammad SAW) with her companionship and assistance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thank Allah (SWT) everyday for this enlightenment, I thank Him for providing Khadijah as such a beautiful example for Muslim women. I persist in my du’as and work towards the day when I hope to meet Khadijah (RA) herself, to offer her salam, and hear from her lips the wisdom that makes me love her so much.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[With so many in need and so much to give, let’s discuss how we can give anonymously!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="color: #800000;">What you give need not cost an arm and a leg. It can be something baked in your oven, grown in your garden or made with your own hands.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The best of alms is that, which the right hand gives and the left hand knows not of.” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>[Bukhari]</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you read this Hadith what are the questions or thoughts that arise in your mind? To me it seems to be implying that the most excellent form of giving is that which we do in private; secretly with no one, not even our own selves in some way, knowing about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know that charity is a part of Islam. There are numerous mentions of it in the Qur’an and there is yet more said about it in the ahadith. All forms of benevolence are permissible and even encouraged: “Charity is a duty unto every Muslim. He who hath not the means there to, let him do a good act or abstain from an evil one. That is his charity.” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>[Bukhari]</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Safety from<em> riya</em></strong></span><br />
So if all forms of giving are acceptable why is one type, namely anonymous giving, seen to be the best kind? It would seem that this is because it is the purest form. By doing something that no-one else knows about or even sees, implies that the only reason it is done is for Allah (SWT). Giving secretly protects us, insha Allah, from <em>riya</em> and from doing things in search of praise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once, the Prophet (SAW) heard a man praising another, and he responded to him, ”May Allah’s Mercy be upon you! You have cut the neck of your friend.” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>[Bukhari]</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Praise can be poisonous as it can spoil good intentions and the related deeds. If someone hears praise for their actions it can affect them so that the focus and reason for what they are doing changes. The main desire is now to hear those words again so that the ego can be fed and we can be made to feel special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Nurturing selflessness</strong></span><br />
Another very important dimension of not knowing the source of a gift is that it leaves the beneficiary free of indebtedness to anyone other than Allah (SWT). They can still make du’a for you because we do not need to know who someone is to pray for them. It can also cause a person to feel special and grateful when they realise that someone, potentially a stranger, is willing to do something for them without expecting thanks or reward. An altruistic and selfless act can help restore faith, usually in humanity, at a time when we seem to be living in an individual-orientated world where a person’s rights are more important than their responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incognito giving is harder than it sounds as there are not so many ways of doing something charitable that enable you to remain nameless. Most things we do can be seen by at least one other being, the person we are performing a kindness towards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for the person who manages to give alms in this manner, he/she will be one of the seven types of people that will attain Allah’s I shelter on that Day when there will be no other shelter. <span style="color: #999999;"><em>[Bukhari and Muslim]</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Ideas for some Anonymous Giving</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #800000;"> <strong><em>Donations</em></strong></span><br />
In this digital era, we have the means of anonymous giving literally at our fingertips. You can donate to any number of charities and causes through various giving pages (e.g. justgiving, ummahgiving and virgin giving). You have the choice on such sites to leave a message with or without disclosing your identity. The premise of a lot of these sites is to encourage others to donate by getting your nearest and dearest to make large donations (as they are most likely to give more), but I have noticed that this works very well with sizeable ‘anonymous’ donations too. Sponsoring people has never been easier!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><em><strong>Sending Anonymous Gifts</strong></em></span><br />
This one can be a nice thing to do for loved ones as well as those you do not know so well. It doesn’t just have to be flowers nor does it have to be expensive. You can make something yourself and send it through the post without putting a return address on it. Husbands can make wives feel very special (and vice versa) by sending gifts without signing their names to it. Also a word to the wise: know your recipient and the people they live with; it’s best to keep gifts as inoffensive as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you give as mentioned earlier need not cost an arm and a leg. It can be something baked in your oven, grown in your garden or made with your own hands. These can be left on doorsteps for those that live in walking distance from you. How about if you know that someone needs or wants something? For example when you are out with your friend and you notice she doesn’t buy the dress she loves because she doesn’t have enough money, why not return at a later date and buy that very same garment for her and have it sent to her address? Or if you’ve realised that your neighbour’s childrens’ shoes are worn out and you know that they are struggling financially, perhaps you could post some vouchers for a shoe shop through their letterbox one day?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><em><strong>Paying off someone’s debt or bill</strong></em></span><br />
If someone that you know is struggling with debt, through no fault of their own and you know who that money is owed to you could, should you have the means, pay off the debt. When you do this it is important to make it clear to the person who has been paid that you do not want the individual whose arrears you have just cleared knowing that you have paid it, only that the unpaid sum has been fulfilled. Or why not, when you are at a restaurant with some friends, surreptitiously satisfy the bill as you go to powder your nose? Again clue in the person who has accepted payment otherwise you may not remain the mysterious and unknown patron for long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be quite fun thinking of ways to carry out the task of being a nameless benefactor. Be creative and enjoy, remembering that ‘All praise and thanks belong to Allah (SWT)’!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>In keeping with the spirit of the article, the writer wishes to remain unknown but she hopes you will remember her in your du’as if it has been of benefit to you.</em></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Yasmin Mogahed reflects on the ultimate love.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are some people who spend their whole lives seeking. Sometimes giving, sometimes taking. Sometimes chasing. But often, just waiting. They believe that love is a place that you get to, a destination at the end of a long road. And they can’t wait for that road to end at their destination. They are those hearts moved by the movement of hearts. That hopeless romantic, the sucker for a love story, or any sincere expression of true devotion. For them, the search is almost a lifelong obsession. And although this tragic ‘quest’ can have its costs &#8211; it can also bring gifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The path of expectations and of ‘falling in love with love’ is a painful one, but it can bring its own lessons. Lessons about the nature of love, this world, people, and one’s own heart, can pave this often painful path. Most of all, this path can bring its own lessons about the Creator of love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who take this route will often reach the understanding that the human love they seek was not the destination. Some form of that human love can be a gift. It can be a means. But the moment you make it the end, you will fall. And you will live your whole life with the wrong focus. You will become willing to sacrifice the true goal for the sake of the means. You will give your life to reaching a ‘destination’ of worldly perfection that does not exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the one who runs after a mirage never gets there, but keeps running. And so too will you keep running, and be willing to lose sleep, cry, bleed, and sacrifice precious parts of yourself &#8211; at times, even your own dignity. But you’ll never reach what you’re looking for in this life, because what you seek isn’t a worldly destination. The type of perfection you seek cannot be found in the material world. It can only be found in God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That image of human love that you seek is an mirage in the desert of life. So if that is what you seek, you’ll keep chasing. But no matter how close you get to a mirage, you never touch it. You can’t hold a creation of your own mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet you dedicate your whole life to reaching this ‘place’. You do this because, in the fairy tale, that’s where the story ends. It ends at the finding, the joining, the wedding. It is found at the oneness of two souls. And everyone around you will make you think that your path ends there: at the place where you meet your soul mate, your other half &#8211; at the point in the path where you get married. Then and only then, they tell you, will you ever finally be complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This, of course, is a lie because completion cannot be found in anything other than God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the lesson you’ve been taught since the time you were little &#8211; from every story, every song, every movie, every ad, every well-meaning auntie &#8211; is that you aren’t complete otherwise. And if, God forbid, you are one of the ‘outcasts’ who hasn’t  got married, or has been divorced, you are considered deficient or incomplete in some way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lesson you’re taught is that the story ends at the wedding, and then that’s when Jannah (paradise) begins. That’s when you’ll be saved and completed and everything that was once broken will be fixed. The only problem is, that’s not where the story ends. That’s where it begins. That’s where the building starts: the building of a life, the building of your character, the building of sabr, perseverance, and sacrifice. The building of selflessness. The building of love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the building of your path back to Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if the person you marry becomes your ultimate focus in life, your struggle has just begun. Now your spouse will become your greatest test. Until you remove that person from the place in your heart that only God should be, it will keep hurting. Ironically, your spouse will become the tool for this painful extraction process, until you learn that there are places in the human heart made only for God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the other lessons you may learn along this path &#8211; after a long road of loss, gain, failure, success, and so many mistakes &#8211; is that there are at least two types of love. There will be some people you love because of what you get from them: what they give you, the way they make you feel. This is perhaps the majority of love &#8211; which is also what makes much of love so unstable. A person’s capacity to give is inconstant and changing. Your response to what you are given is also inconstant and changing. So if you’re chasing a feeling, you’ll always be chasing.  No feeling is ever constant. If love is dependent on this, it too becomes inconstant and changing. And just like everything in this world, the more you chase it, the more it will run away from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, once in a while, people enter your life that you love &#8211; not for what they give you &#8211; but for what they are. The beauty you see in them is a reflection of the Creator, so you love them. Now suddenly it isn’t about what you’re getting, but rather what you can give. This is unselfish love. This second type of love is the rarest. And if it is based in, and not competing with, the love of God, it will also bring about the most joy. To love in any other way is to need, to be dependent, to have expectations &#8211; all the ingredients for misery and disappointment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for all those who have spent their life seeking, know that the purity of any thing is found at the Source. If it is love that you seek, seek it through God. Every other stream, not based in His love, poisons the one who drinks from it. And the drinker will continue to drink, until the poison all but kills him. He will continue to die more and more inside, until he stops and finds the pure Source of water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you begin to see everything beautiful as only a reflection of God’s beauty, you will learn to love in the right way: for His sake. Everything and everyone you love with be for, through and because of Him. The foundation of such love is God. So what you hold onto will no longer be just an unstable feeling, a fleeting emotion. And what you chase will no longer be just a temporary high. What you hold, what you chase, what you love, will be God: the only constant. Thereafter, everything else will be through Him. Everything you give or take or love or don’t love, will be, not by your nafs, but by Him.  It will not be for your nafs. It will be for Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means you will love what He loves and not love what He does not love. And when you do love, you will give to the creation &#8211; not for what you can get in return from them. You will love and you will give, but you will be sufficed by Him. And the one who is sufficed by God is the richest and most generous of all lovers. Your love will be by Him, for Him, and because of Him. That is the liberation of the self from servitude to any created thing. And that is freedom. That is happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is love.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[These days advice is dished out to our sisters without an ounce of compassion or understanding. K.T. Lynn provides some ideas for ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first became Muslim the amount of advice, or naseeha, that I received was overwhelming. Every Muslim acquaintance I had rushed to offer me their opinions on everything from my hijab to suggestions on changing my name. It seemed there was not a topic off limits, large or small. People I had never met before would notice me, say their salams and immediately launch into their topic of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During one of my first congregational prayers, a woman whispered in my ear in the middle of salah, “your prayers are not accepted by Allah (SWT) because you are wearing nail polish”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ignored her and continued praying, but I was so distracted by her laser-like gaze that I lost all of my focus and concentration. After finishing the prayer, I left the mosque as quickly as possible, doing my best to avoid the woman who so starkly claimed my prayers were not counting as good deeds. Although after doing research on my own I became enlightened to the fact that nail polish did affect my wudhu, I was still shocked by her rude actions and bold assumptions. This woman, although attempting to be helpful, failed to realise that her actions could have potentially been more harmful than beneficial. Due to her approach and declarations, I had an emotional reaction to her words. If she had waited for me to finish and approached me privately and in a nice manner, I could have possibly been open to her advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my time as a new Muslim, many different voices of advice rang out from every direction and all overlapping and contradicting each other. Not having a trusted relative or guardian who I could turn to for religious guidance, I was forced to gather information, even the ‘white noise’ of some, read as much as I could, research online and try to sort it out for myself. Until I moved to a town with a large Muslim population and joined an inclusive masjid, I was without any sort of pillar for guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a convert is being like a ship approaching the shore in the fog, desperately seeking a lighthouse for guidance to avoid the danger of the rocks that threaten to turn you over. It pains me to say that a lot of the advice I received was not grounded in <em>&#8216;ilm</em> (knowledge), but was personal opinion or preference. In spite of this, my requests for advice were always met with enthusiasm and energy. This energy and enthusiasm, although helpful in illustrating that the giver of advice was meaning well, still never carried the message in quite the right way for me to be receptive to it. What was missing from their dealings with me, although I didn’t realise it at the time, was compassion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people were quick to discuss hijab, marriage or other parts of Islam often heavily debated throughout the community. Not one person ever discussed tawhid with me. Sadly, I have also met converts who do not know how to pray, make wudhu or fast properly. Naseeha that is lacking compassion is generally lacking substance. Most converts can detail experiences dealing with advice they received about their appearance, marriages, sect or scholars, but few can assert that someone actually sat down with them to ensure they understood the very basics of Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, some people might confuse having compassion for the person who is sinning with condoning their sin. On the contrary, compassion is simply a deep feeling of sympathy and sorrow for another who is suffering, accompanied by a strong desire to alleviate the suffering. Most Muslims who are not converts themselves do not realise that converts are suffering and struggling with themselves and their identities. Even under the best of circumstances, they are starting their entire lives over. Most naseeha that comes their way is not coming from a place of compassion. A person who is starting their life over again needs to build a strong foundation to their life. They have priorities that need to be reconfigured and an entire existence that needs to be reconstructed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it might seem helpful to encourage a new Muslimah to wear hijab or a new Muslim to grow a beard, it can sometimes be superfluous or worse, detrimental. A deluge of advice is not what a new Muslim needs. Depending on where they are in their journey, they could simply need to know how to pray or how to fast. Bombarding them with information for which they are not ready can simply amount to breath and time wasted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Advice for giving naseeha</strong></span><br />
In Arabic naseeha means “sincerity” as well as “advice” and is perhaps best understood as “sincere counsel”. A person giving naseeha should, as a fellow Muslim and a fellow sinner, feel the deep connection to this person, but also want to save them from what they are doing. They should understand the position that this other person is in and know for sure that the words they will provide them with will lift them up and not tear them down. It is too often that people in the Muslim community treat new Muslims like children, idiots or heathens, simply because their spiritual years are not many. There is a proper way to provide naseeha in Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong>Set your intention to seek the pleasure of Allah (SWT)</strong></em></span><br />
Examine your intentions to guarantee you desire providing advice for the right reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong>Give naseeha with kindness and compassion</strong></em></span><br />
Ensure that your naseeha is worded in a way that does not attack the receiver. Typically, humans have emotional investment in their actions and naseeha in this case requires delicate words and diplomacy. Converts especially sometimes hold on to ghosts of their past for emotional reasons without realising their harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) said &#8220;Kindness is not to be found in anything but that it adds to its beauty and it is not withdrawn from anything but it makes it defective.&#8221; <span style="color: #999999;"><em>[Muslim]</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong>Choose the proper time and place</strong></em></span><br />
The proper time does not just reference the time of day, it also refers to the proper time in that convert’s life. If the convert does not understand tawhid or how to pray, it is probably not going to be useful for them to receive advice about marriage or about giving da’wah to their parents. Make sure this person is not distracted by other looming issues in their life so they can actually be a proper audience, which is why compassion is such an integral part of naseeha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proper place ensures that the receiver of naseeha is most open to the advice and does not feel embarrassed or humiliated. It is best to give naseeha in private and with a voice that engages only the listener, not others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong>Choose content wisely</strong></em></span><br />
It is too often that a new convert feels the pull of different cultures early on in their time as a Muslim. Unbeknownst to them or not, converts are often advised about cultural practices that have been mixed with Islam. Do not mix culture with a perfect religion and then pass that along!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giving naseeha is an important task that is essential to the growing Muslim community. However, it is too often practiced imperfectly and rendered ineffective. By taking on this important duty, it is important to remember the burden of our own sins so we may compassionately attempt to assist our brothers and sisters in their own struggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although reverts to Islam are most susceptible to erroneous advice and misguided naseeha, this reminder is in no way limited to only those who are new to Islam. Naseeha is an important part of our religion, not to be trivialised or abandoned. Any time naseeha is given, whether it be to the fresh-faced recent revert or the eighty-year-old born Muslim, the advice must be given with the same boundaries of sincerity and respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said, &#8220;Religion (din) is sincerity (naseeha &#8211; corrective advice, good counsel and sincere conduct). The din is naseeha. The din is naseeha.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;To whom, Messenger of Allah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To Allah and His Book and His Messenger and the imams (leaders) of the Muslims and the common people.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In the midst of a thunder storm, Faiza Dean Omar finds peace and serenity in the early morning hours while performing the Tahajjud]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rain falls steadily outside. A loud clap of thunder shakes me from my slumber. Subhan’Allah, my husband’s reassuring arms gather me close to him. My heart pounds in my ears and my first thought is our son – has the thunder disturbed his sleep?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stand over him, he sleeps peacefully &#8211; blissfully unaware of the storm… or perhaps subtly aware but still undisturbed. I settle back against the pillows but prayer beckons to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How beautiful and tranquil the night is. The smell of the rain is magical, the blackness of the night sky is brought to life with bright flashes of light – Subhan’Allah, what a magnificent display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stand in prayer, Qiyaam-al-Layl, and I pour my heart out to Him who owns it. My tears come in a steady stream, almost as if trying to match the pace of the rain. I reflect on what I know about this time – the last part of the night, that Allah (SWT) descends from His “Arsh to the lowest Heaven,  and says: “Who will call upon Me, that I may answer Him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?” <span style="color: #999999;"><i>(Bukhari and Muslim)</i></span>. I feel Allah’s presence. I know He is hearing my supplications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I lament the many, many  nights I have slept soundly and missed out on this special time. Yet I am ever hopeful in His Mercy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The night is so quiet. I can hear the soft baby breaths of my sleeping son, and the intermittent snoring of my husband. I whisper supplications of gratitude for them. My husband &#8211; my protector and my best friend, and our son &#8211; my every dream come true, Alhamdulillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My heart is happy. This is my time with my Creator. My mind is clear, my thoughts are focused and I attempt to make my Dua’as as succinct and concise as I possibly can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the birth of my son nearly two years ago, I have felt that the majority of my time is consumed with raising him, teaching him, and keeping my home, and while that in itself serves as an act of ‘Ibaadah, I am regretful of not praying as much, and in the manner I would have liked to. But I know that Allah (SWT) knows my heart, and I know that His promise is always, always true – He does not place upon us burdens greater than we are capable of carrying. I know that He hears me and He understands my plight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My hands are raised in Du’a, my heart beseeching Him, my lips begging for His Mercy and Favour upon me. I am at peace. “(There is) a Word: “Peace! From a Lord Most Merciful.” <span style="color: #999999;"><i>(Surah Ya-sin: 58) </i></span>Allahu Akbar!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I complete my prayers and it feels as though a new wave of energy has washed over me. The rain still falls, softer now… washing the dust and dirt from the earth, each drop a quenching drink to its dry lips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is Allah’s Mercy – nourishing our souls, nurturing and sustaining us. Subhana Rabbi-al A’ala!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My night light flickers and I am submerged in total darkness. The power has gone. How symbolic, I think to myself. My life, like this light, can be extinguished in an instant, without any prior warning or notification. Again I raise my hands, and I pray, “Oh my Lord, let me die not but in a state of Imaan and let me not return to You except in a manner that is pleasing to You.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I smile and I am thankful for this beautiful gift of Tahajjud.<br />
<i>Rabbana wata-qabbal du’a.  </i>“O my Lord! Accept my dua’as.”<span style="color: #999999;"> <i>(Surah Ibrahim: 40)</i></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Zainab bint Younus hopes to revive the stories of our forgotten heroines by taking a deeper look at the women in the history of Is]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muslim women in the West today are in a seemingly unique position, often straddling two worlds &#8211; that of their family’s ethnic culture and that of their Western country of residence. They are struggling to both revive their faith and their intellect, managing a balancing act of family and career.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, we feel alone, stranded in circumstances for which there is no textbook manual on how to do it all right. Surely we can’t be the only generation of Muslim women to face such trials! In fact, we aren’t. Islamic history books are filled with stories of exemplary Muslim women, young and old, who navigated cultures spanning from Asia and Arabia to Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These inspiring women came of age in environments eerily similar to our own: Fatimah bint Muhammad (SAW), whose early teen years were spent struggling through the difficult first days of Islam in Makkah; and  Ama bint Khalid, who grew up in the Christian country of Abyssinia during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW). They dealt with feelings of isolation, cultural differences and the struggles faced by the pioneers of a new way. They fell in love, fought in wars and achieved heights of scholarship envied by men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Sahabiyat (female Companions) to female scholars in our own times, Muslim women have always had powerful female figures to look up to and emulate. Unfortunately, however, these inspiring women have been forgotten and marginalised by their own people, to the detriment of all Muslims, both men and women.<br />
Now, we hope to revive and relive our neglected history by bringing to light not only the exploits of these heroines, but their humanity as well. We aim to build a direct connection and sense of relevance between the current generations of Muslim women and those who created legacies before us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e6255b;"><strong>Coming of Age in a New World</strong></span></p>
<p>Modern society marks the transition from childhood into adolescence with contemporary constructs such as issues of identity and angst. For young Muslimahs in the West, these struggles are compounded with further questions about religion, spirituality and their place as citizens in societies whose values are often at great odds with those of Islam’s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ama bint Khalid was one of the first young Muslimahs to grow up in a non-Muslim environment and whose love for the Messenger of Allah (SAW) blossomed in her heart before she ever met him. Her parents were amongst the earliest believers in RasulAllah (SAW) and were of those who made the first hijrah (emigration) to Abyssinia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, Ama was one of a handful of young Muslims who grew up in a distinctly Christian society. Though she undoubtedly faced difficulties and challenges, her identity as a Muslim was strengthened by her circumstances, rather than weakened or driven to compromise. Her parents would regularly share with her and remind her of the reason for which they emigrated: their belief in Allah (SWT) and His Messenger. They would tell her stories about RasulAllah (SAW) – his kindness, his generosity, his concern for others even if they were not his family or friends and how he worked so hard to save everyone from the terrifying punishment of the Hereafter. Long before she ever met him, Ama loved this amazing man of whom her parents spoke so fondly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ama was a young girl faced with a massive challenge: living and growing up in a country foreign to her family, struggling to learn a new language and a new culture and, more importantly, retaining the faith for which they had emigrated in the first place. In the midst of this utter strangeness, she fiercely held onto her belief in God and His Messenger (SAW), her saviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the challenges are many, young Muslims in the 21st century are not the first to experience isolation, alienation and negative propaganda directly concentrated on their faith. Youth such as Ama bint Khalid and ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (RA), both of whom were raised upon Islam from a very young age, grew up in a society where they were labelled as either crazy people, terrorists or both. Most Muslim teenagers often think that they have little in common with famous and awe-inspiring Sahabah of the Prophet’s time, but the truth is that their struggles were very similar to those we are going through today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, young Muslims in the West have far more available and at their disposal than Ama bint Khalid had over 1400 years ago. Masjid youth groups, Islamic schools, youth conferences, CDs and DVDs; these resources provide not only knowledge, but a strength of solidarity for young Muslims growing up in non-Muslim societies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teenage Muslim girls who are trying to juggle their non-Muslim school environment, culturally-different home environment and plain old teen hormones need look no further than Ama bint Khalid to feel both comforted and inspired. If Ama could do it – in a time when there was no internet, no halal takeout and no varieties of cute hijabs – why can’t you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrated Sa&#8217;id: Um Khalid [Ama] bint Khalid bin Said said, &#8220;I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger along with my father and I was wearing a yellow shirt. Allah&#8217;s Messenger said, &#8220;Sanah Sanah!&#8221; (&#8216;Abdullah, the sub-narrator said, &#8220;It means, &#8216;Nice, nice!&#8217; in the Ethiopian language.&#8221;) Um Khalid added, &#8220;Then I started playing with the seal of Prophethood. My father admonished me. But Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to my father), &#8220;Leave her,&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (then addressing me) said, &#8220;May you live so long that your dress gets worn out, and you will mend it many times, and then wear another till it gets worn out (i.e. May Allah prolong your life).&#8221; (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah aid, &#8220;That garment (which she was wearing) remained usable for a long time.&#8221;) <em>Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 73, Number 22</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Umm Khadijah (Zainab bint Younus) is a young woman who finds constant inspiration in the lives of the Sahabiyat and other great women in Islamic history. She hopes that every Muslimah is able to identify with the struggles of these inspirational women and follow in their footsteps to become part of a new generation of powerful Muslimahs.</em></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this mini-series, Umm-e-Ismaeel shares how the lives of two maids taught her a lesson in gratitude.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I once read somewhere that all people come into your life for a reason &#8211; maybe to teach you an important lesson or to help you learn patience or to remind you to be grateful for what you have. Or maybe you just needed them at the time for friendship. I believe Parveen and Maria came into my life for all the above reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parveen comes to our house to iron and wash the clothes. For years, her routine has always been the same. She enters the house, takes the dirty laundry to the backyard where a small area with a tap has been set up for doing the laundry, soaks it in a tub, enters the house and starts ironing. When she’s done, she goes back outside, washes the clothes (with freezing water in the winter), hangs them to dry and then leaves. All of this is done in utter silence; she doesn’t speak unless spoken to and, if she does speak, it is only to ask for the washing detergent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got to know Parveen a few weeks before my delivery. Being pregnant with my first baby, I needed prenatal massages on a regular basis for my sciatic pains and because they would hopefully be beneficial to my newborn’s health. My mother-in-law suggested I ask Parveen. In Pakistan, it is an understood fact that women of the labour class are usually good at giving massages. Their bodies become strong and robust due to the manual labour they do every day and they also learn the art from their mothers and grandmothers. So I arranged with Parveen to massage me daily for 30-60 minutes after her work was done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, as silent as Parveen was while working, she was quite the chatterbox during our massage sessions. It seemed as if she needed someone to talk to and in me she found a good listener. I started asking questions to get to know her and she would regale me with stories from her past and present. As she spoke in Punjabi, I didn’t always understand what she said, but despite that I would nod my head and smile or frown at the appropriate times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Parveen, who is in her 50s, has nine children &#8211; six sons and three daughters. Her husband is in the army; hence the family has been living for years in rent-free accommodation. Army life also requires her husband to travel for long periods, leaving his family behind. During one of these times many years ago, Parveen was heavily pregnant with her fifth child. As is common among the labour class, they prefer to go to a local midwife rather than a doctor, even though being in the army entitles them to free health care in the army hospital. The midwife is usually not professionally trained or certified. Whatever she knows, she will have learnt from her mother or grandmother and her own experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Parveen’s sister took care of the children while she had her delivery. An hour or so after the delivery, her sister left to take care of her own children. Soon after, Parveen’s children came to her room and said they were hungry. Even the oldest child was not old enough to put together a meal for the young ones. So Parveen, despite just having endured a painfully long labour and delivery, got up to make a meal for her children. She instructed the eldest child to bring her a chicken from the few they had. Once the chicken was delivered to her, she slaughtered it, skinned it and cooked it to feed the hungry mouths around her. The needs of her children gave her strength to do what few people could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A few years later, tragedy struck Parveen’s household. Her three year old daughter, Muskaan, contracted chicken pox, which is a common illness, but ignorance turned it deadly. Parveen didn’t know how to treat the illness so she asked a cousin of hers for advice. That cousin promptly applied oil all over Muskaan’s body. In the Indian Subcontinent, most people out of ignorance believe that oil massages are a cure-all. Soon after, Muskaan started vomiting blood and rolling her eye balls upward. Her father rushed her to the hospital but Parveen stayed behind; she couldn’t bear to see her beloved daughter in so much pain. At the hospital Muskaan had difficulty breathing. The doctor at the hospital put an oxygen mask on her but informed her father that it might be too late to do anything. They injected her with drugs, placed an IV into her, but to no avail. At 10 am the next morning, Muskaan breathed her last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tragic loss of her innocent little angel robbed Parveen of peace of mind. She sunk into depression, couldn’t string together more than a few sentences in a day; for years she lived like a mechanical robot. It was only her Christian beliefs and support from her family that helped her through her ordeal. At her husband’s advice, she started working again. She lost herself in her work, going from house to house, zealously washing and ironing clothes. The hard work gradually lifted Parveen’s depression and, after many years, she finally found closure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges in her life didn’t end though. A few years later, her teenage son was involved in a car accident. While waiting on the curb for a rickshaw, a car coming at full speed crashed into him. The driver of the car rushed him to hospital, where it was found that his right leg was badly crushed. He needed multiple surgeries; the driver gave an initial amount that was enough for one surgery, but disappeared after that. It was bad enough for Parveen to see her son in so much pain, but she also had to endure the humiliation of going around asking for money for her son’s surgeries. After more than two years of surgeries and physiotherapy, her son can finally walk, but with a limp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of writing this article, Parveen was tried yet again. Two of her sons are part of a group of young men who clean the streets in our compound. A theft took place in a nearby house and the mistress of the house put the blame on one of the men who cleans her gardens. She had him arrested and he blamed the entire group. One of her sons was arrested and she told the other son (who has a weak leg because of the car accident) to run and hide in a relative’s house outside the compound. She knew if the police beat him he could suffer permanent damage to his leg. For five days she kept going to the police station and giving them an earful. Even though she belongs to the labour class, she captured their attention and respect. For her son’s sake, she became a fearless lioness in front of authority. After six days in custody, he was finally released on bail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Parveen’s struggles moved me and made me cringe with shame. Like the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: “If one of you looks at a person who is better than him in wealth and body (charm), let him look at the people beneath him.” <em>(Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim)</em> This is the right attitude of a believer. Doing that made me realise how privileged my life is. I have taken so many things for granted: travelling in planes and cars, visiting different countries, enjoying a variety of food, never having to really work unless I wanted to and not because I had to – the list is endless. When she told me about her pregnancy, it made me wonder if I could be so strong had I been put in such a situation. I felt ashamed when I pondered upon the small things I complained about and how frustrated I often felt when my life wasn’t taking the direction I wanted it to. Her struggles taught me to be patient in times of stress or hardship and from her suffering I learned not to moan and groan about inconsequential things like how so-and-so said this and that or how the tailor ruined my outfit.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Lotifa Begum discusses the making of a ‘real man’ by exploring qualities of the most perfect man of all time.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most women long to meet the man of their dreams, the ideal man who will be their knight in shining armour. As Muslim women we don&#8217;t need to look to movies or fiction to teach us what makes a real man, rather we need only look to the beautiful example of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) to truly understand the mark of a real man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In this article, we explore just some of the marks of manhood as seen in the Prophet (SAW). This list is by no means exhaustive but they have been carefully selected to challenge the common misconceptions in our society of what really makes a real man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #d19152;"><strong>He was a man on a noble mission</strong></span><br />
Without a doubt, the Prophet (SAW) had the biggest mission on Earth: to convey the message of Islam and spread it to others in a hostile and often unwelcoming world. This was a huge task which he undertook with his Companions (RA) and over the course of 23 years he strived tirelessly to deliver the noble mission Allah (SWT) had given him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah says in the Qur’an: “And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) but as a mercy to the worlds.” <em>(Al-Anbiyaa’:107)</em> This is a remarkable mark of his leadership not only for the Muslim Ummah but also for any man ever noted in humanity as the most influential man in history. This should teach us women to raise sons and men who strive in the path of a noble cause; they should have a higher goal in their life than merely graduating and getting a good job. Instead, we should seek to raise sons who are devoted to the mission of being a good Muslim for humanity at large. The Prophet (SAW) said: “The best of people are those that bring most benefit to the rest of mankind.” <em>(Daraqutni, Hasan)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d19152;"><strong>He was a man of action</strong></span><br />
The Prophet (SAW) took responsibility for himself and was your DIY kind of man. His wife ‘A’isha (RA) narrates that the Holy Prophet (SAW) used to mend his shoes, sew his clothes and work in his household just as one of you works in his own house. She also reported that he was a man among men who used to patch his clothes, milk his goats and engage himself in work (Tirmidhi). In some communities, the idea of a man doing any domestic chores is frowned upon; however, we must teach our brothers, sons and husbands about the Prophetic model of taking responsibility for their own actions. We should encourage our men to have qualities such as taking responsibility and taking action at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #d19152;"><strong>He was a family man</strong></span><br />
The narration above also shows us how the Prophet (SAW), despite the demands of political leadership for the Ummah, always managed to make time for his family. Unfortunately, today we find many brothers actively volunteering for great causes outside of the home yet they are neglecting their family. It is essential that a real man seeks to strike a balance by giving his wife, children and family quality time as well as helping around the house. The Prophet (SAW) would ensure that he gave time equally and fairly to his wives as none of his wives ever complained about the lack of time they were given by him. Moreover, he was known to be humorous and playful with children which is essential for a man who is going to be a good father so we should seek these qualities in a good man.  It is also narrated in ahadith that the Prophet (SAW) would always stand up as a mark of respect and love whenever Fatima (RA) would enter a room &#8211; how many fathers would do that today?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d19152;"><strong>He was a community man</strong></span><br />
Due to his very generous and soft nature, the Prophet (SAW) was known to be a man who cared not only for his family but also the community at large. He was a proactive man when it came to matters of social justice by encouraging others to give in charity and look after the elderly, the weak and the poor. What is particularly striking here is that he was a man who would enquire about the affairs and well-being of widows, elderly women and other weaker members of society, which is something we rarely see in our community leaders today. This is by far one of the most beautiful attributes of a real man &#8211; his care of the wider community. The men we know in our lives should be encouraged to get involved in the community by attending congregation prayers in the mosque regularly and being ready to help the less fortunate in their community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d19152;"><strong>He was a cool-tempered man</strong></span><br />
There are many narrations which teach us that the Prophet (SAW) would never express his anger (it would merely show in his facial expression). Unfortunately, in some societies and cultures, men may use their temper as a mark of their dominance. However this is contrary to the Islamic way of life as the Prophet (SAW) said: &#8220;The strong person is not he who defeats another in wrestling; rather, the strong person is he who has full control over himself during his anger.&#8221; <em>(Bukhari)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d19152;"><strong>He wasn&#8217;t afraid to cry</strong></span><br />
There is an age-old concept that men who cry are somehow considered weak or not masculine enough. Yet we have to remember that expressing our emotions is part of being human. There was a time when the Prophet (SAW) was holding his baby son Ibrahim when he died and tears were rolling down his cheeks. One of his companions, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman ibn `Awf (RA), said: ‘Even you, Messenger of Allah!’ Then he said: ‘Oh Ibn `Awf! It is but mercy.’ He continued (crying) some more and then said, “The eyes weep, the heart is full of grief and we are nothing but that which does not please our Lord. Verily, we are sorrowed for your departure, O! Ibrahim.” <em>(Muslim)</em> This example shows us that it is fine for a man to express his emotions when the situation compels him and he is no less of a man if he does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There we have it: the six traits of the Prophet (SAW) which show us the mark of a real man contrary to what we may have been taught about manhood as we grew up. There are many more qualities of the Prophet (SAW) that we haven&#8217;t touched on. My message to the brothers of today is to strive to emulate these Prophetic qualities so you can be a better brother, a better husband, a better son and a real leader in your homes, communities and society. As for the sisters &#8211; well, I&#8217;d like to say you should only look for the man who ticks all these boxes but it might not be so easy! However, we can do our best to teach our brothers, sons, fathers and the men around us about these beautiful qualities which mark the signs of a real man.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Klaudia Khan sorts through the dizzying disparities in opinions to discover what Islamic feminism is. Or isn’t.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Male Muslim Feminists, do they even exist? Or is it just an oxymoron – a self-contradictory term, a juxtaposition of opposite meaning? Male Muslim feminists may seem as likely to find as unicorns, but then I must be very lucky, because I found quite a few and even had some enlightening conversations with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Muslims say that the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was a feminist. Some call themselves ’Salafi feminists’. Some claim that Islam and feminism are incompatible. Some regard the term ‘feminist’ as pejorative. Some agree that women’s rights are not being fulfilled, but are too confused to declare whether it is an issue for feminism or not. It seemed that every person I spoke to has held a different opinion on the issue. But let’s start from the beginning…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>What is feminism about?</strong></span><br />
That seemed a simple enough question: feminism is about women’s rights, isn’t it? But what are women’s rights? And is there a universal formula for women’s rights? American writer Hope Wabuke in her article ‘How the Attachment-Parenting Debate Ignores Women of Colour’ claims that there is “the division and disconnect between white feminists (the voice of the movement) and feminists of colour, marginalised and silenced”. And if women cannot agree upon their common goals, can we expect men to understand and support feminism? “There is a huge movement of gender scholars that are redefining masculinity and femininity, part of which is greatly harming our young men” says Abdul-Aziz Syed, one of the brothers who helped me in my search for understanding. “Feminism first came up as a reaction to assist women in getting their rights in society which I am all for&#8230; However, modern day feminism is very different.” Aldin Hadzic, the founder of online Taqwa Magazine, says: “The way the modern day society has gone about promoting and fighting for women&#8217;s rights has left a bad taste in the mouths of many.  Women’s fighting for their rights has lead to the demise of ’family’. Women&#8217;s rights are not to be blamed for this, but the approach to getting women&#8217;s rights is to be blamed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Is there such a thing as Muslim feminism?</strong></span><br />
The amount of scholars, writers and activists calling themselves Muslim feminists should be enough to prove that there is. But is feminism an integral part of Islam or is it just a response to a Western-led movement &#8211; a Muslim version of something not inherently Muslim? Again, it depends on the definition of feminism we apply. Because if we presume that feminism is about gender equality, respect, freedom to choose, freedom from violence and oppression then these are the core rights guaranteed to women in the Qur’an. This is also the way many Muslim men perceive it. Sana Saeed, the senior editor of The Islamic Monthly, in her article “My Father the Liberal Salafi Feminist” described how her father presented her at the age of sixteen with handwritten quotes from the Qur’an on women&#8217;s rights and his advice: “These are your God-given rights that no man – be it me, your brother, your future husband, your grandfathers, your countrymen or anyone – can take away from you. You need to be aware of what rights you’ve been given in your religion. The Qur’an is the place to start. You have more power as a woman than anyone has probably ever led you to believe. Read this, read more, learn and practice what you find.” The article wasn’t about feminism, but about labels, and when it comes to feminism – the label is often a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Can Muslim men be feminists?</strong></span><br />
“Islam is the answer any woman who wants her rights is looking for” says Hadzic echoing the opinion of many women that they don’t need feminism if they have Islam. Abdul-Aziz Syed also has some reservations when it comes to tagging. “I have some reservations in labelling myself as a feminist in modern times&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure if this could be labelled as a movement within Islam. I think it is more appropriate to say that we are fulfilling that which Islam requires of us,” says Syed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adeel Ahmed, American actor and writer, has no problem with calling himself a feminist. In fact, in his article “Muslim Men Can Be Feminists” published on the Goatmilk blog he argues that even the Prophet (SAW) himself would have been seen as a feminist by his contemporaries. When I asked him whether it takes courage for a Muslim man to call himself a feminist he said: “It&#8217;s not about courage&#8230; but more so the feeling of doing what is right. I&#8217;d say that what needs to be done on our part is to educate ourselves and the youth and gain knowledge. Once that is done, others may see themselves as &#8216;feminists’.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Where can Muslim feminists be found?</strong></span><br />
If they like this word, that is. Because you don’t have to call yourself a feminist to be a feminist it turns out. Or rather, you don’t have to be a feminist to believe in the equality of men and women and to fight for the neglected rights of your sisters. We know that all the rights that women need are guaranteed by Islam, but not all of them are respected everywhere. Just as women of different colour and creed may campaign for different feminist goals, so in Islam there are different needs in different communities. In the US, where all of the brothers that helped me in this research reside, the number one on the Muslim feminist agenda seems to be women’s participation in mosques and leadership in religious communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The striking difference between the facilities available to brothers and sisters in many American mosques has in fact led many to read more on the subject and become involved in the women’s rights movement in the first place. Adeel Ahmed relates his experience as a trigger and on many blogs you can find self-proclaimed American Muslim male feminists (the labels!) calling for a proper space for their sisters’ prayer. Is it a coincidence that it is easiest to find our feminist brothers in America? “Perhaps in America, we are more exposed to the ’women&#8217;s rights’ idea because it seems like it originated from here&#8230; We&#8217;re overexposed to it&#8230;” ponders Aldin Hadzic. And the cultural surrounding might be a key to absence of male feminist voices in other countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Junaid Jamshed, famous Pakistani activist and an ex-cricket player, who is involved in charity work improving maternal health facilities in the rural areas of Pakistan admits that “It is sad how women are objectified. Rights to women have been given by the Creator&#8230; [But] For the sake of family honour, Pakistani women continue to suffer&#8230; In a society where male-child preference still exists and women are blamed for producing too many daughters, will men not stand up for them? I have always felt strongly about the rights of women.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Will men stand up for us?</strong></span><br />
As Muslims we believe that men and women are equal, but not the same. Their role in the family and society is also different and it is men who were primarily granted leadership. They should lead in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah, but when cultures they grow up in tell them that they, men, are better than women and it is ok this way, they may not feel there is much need to discuss it. Or they may accept the principles, but find so many more important things to attend to first. After all, women’s rights are not such a well-liked topic. It is not likely to win any Muslim leader popularity, as even many women to some extent passively support the oppressive systems. But leadership is about responsibility and about acting on the principles. “Islam tells us that Paradise lies at the feet of your mother, raising three pious daughters is your doorway to Paradise and that the best of men is the one who is best to his wife” said brother Hadzic explaining his pro-women stance. Let us hope that our brothers will realise that it is not only their mothers, daughters and wives that need respect and protection, but all the women – all the sisters in Islam. And let us hope that Allah (SWT) will give them wisdom and strength to stand up for them – to stand up for us. Ameen.</p>
