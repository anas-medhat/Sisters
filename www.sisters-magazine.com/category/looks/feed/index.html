				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> Tell us about yourselves</strong></p>
<p>Azara Beautique comes to you from the heart of the Middle East, offering the purest cosmetic products, created and blended with the rare and refined jewels of the Arab world. We draw our inspiration from long-standing Arab tradition of working with and not against nature. For centuries, the Arab world has sought the answer to caring for our inner and outer selves through the indepth study of native herbs and nature for daily care and medicinal use and these traditional secrets have been passed on from generation to generation and into our brand. Dr. Samira Zaidan, my mother, who is Saudi, has been a certified homeopath in both the UK and Saudi Arabia for over 20 years and I, Dr. Mona Alyedreessy, am originally a sociologist, however I have been very passionate in my mother&#8217;s work for many years and decided a few years ago to get involved with the business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to start a soap business?</strong></p>
<p>When we first started this project in my mother&#8217;s homeopathic clinic in Saudi Arabia, we noticed that a lot of people were amazed at the results of using many of the herbs, plants and resins that my mother had recommended to them to treat a variety of health problems. The idea of making soaps came from the demand of my mother&#8217;s patients for healthy and organic soaps that were free from preservatives, chemicals and fragrances and that which included the herbs, resins and plants that were suitable for their skin and scalp conditions. We found these soaps to be a success among them and we decided to create a collection of cosmetics using special herbs and resins that are known in the Arab World for their medicinal and healing properties. All of our products are 100% natural, organic, halal, chemical-free, not tested on animals, primarily vegan, handmade, sulfate/paraben free and have all been tested, approved and certified by UK labs to meet the highest of EU cosmetic safety standards.<b> </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What is the inspiration behind the brand, ingredients etc?</strong></p>
<p>I was raised since I was a child to use homeopathic medicines and natural Middle Eastern herbs to treat a wide range of health issues and they would always work. Therefore my deep trust in these herbs, oils, waters, plants and raw ingredients is what inspired me to take the business to another level and create a more professional international brand that focuses mainly on the quality and medical/health/cosmetic benefits of our ingredients. I chose to call our online &#8216;beautique&#8217; Azara, which means pure and virgin in Arabic, reflecting our use of the highest grade of ingredients and extra virgin oils, which I believe is what makes a difference to people&#8217;s skin, hair and overall wellbeing. We travelled across North Africa and The Middle East to collect all of our raw ingredients from local family businesses/farmers in the deserts and mountains. Our aim is to support small family businesses via fair-trade agreements in order to benefit as many people in this project as possible. You can find info about our journeys posted on our Instagram page!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Which is your favourite soap and why?</strong></p>
<p>Our favourite soap has to be the Fig, Olive and Zamzam soap as it was inspired by Sura 95 in The Quran and the immense health benefits that are in each ingredient. This particular soap has profound healing properties and has been a popular choice among our customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What makes the mother/daughter bond special?</strong></p>
<p>It is a beautiful thing to be able to work with family members who are as passionate as you are about your work. I have always had a very close relationship with my mother and we both have very similar personalities, which makes her very easy to work with. We do not have any official working hours between us, which is an advantage, as we sometimes stay up until 3am working on formulas and other aspects of the business, which is something you cannot do with regular employees. We are both working together to make the business a success, rather than perceiving it solely as a financial venture. It is really important for us to spread the medical knowledge of the ingredients we use so that people can benefit from the knowledge my mother has accumulated over the years. It makes us so happy to know that people have greatly benefited from using our products. It also helps to have a consultant at hand each time advice is needed and my mother is always there when I need her on board for anything. The main bonus however, is the fact our relationship has become stronger from working together alongside the ability to keep certain production secrets within the family, so it is something that I would love to pass on to my daughter one day too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>How do you divide the business tasks between yourselves?</strong></p>
<p>I handle the business side of things and my mother deals with the product side of things &#8211; so she perfects the formulas and makes sure that the products are all made in the correct way and that the information that is posted/published about the ingredients and how to use them are correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What challenges did you face when setting up the business?</strong></p>
<p>We originally tried to set up the business in Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia but it was a very long, expensive and tedious process as a British citizen. It was required of us to open a commercial factory in order to be registered as a soap business, however we did not wish to do this because we did not want to lose the novelty of the products being individually handmade and wrapped. We use very expensive ingredients in our products and it would have been too expensive to run a large scale factory, so we decided to open a company in the UK and it was a much easier and affordable process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What are your hopes for the business?</strong></p>
<p>We hope that we can one day open our own boutique store in a high-end location in London and we would love to open a few branches in The Middle East too! Our goal at the moment is reaching out to everyone who appreciates high quality natural cosmetics that are beneficial for their health &#8211; and making them easily available in department stores perhaps or other boutiques and health stores to begin with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Name 3 women who inspire you</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Al Sayyeda Khadija (r.a) &#8211; the greatest of all women who taught us how to be great business women, independent, family women, wives, mothers and people who contribute positively to our local communities.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Yasmine Mogahed &#8211; An American Egyptian life coach/counsellor who has affected me with her talks about positivity, leading a healthy and spiritual lifestyle and self development.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>My mother, who has been my inspiration in everything I have done and achieved since I was a young girl.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What are your favourite ayahs from the Qur&#8217;an?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;And when My servants ask you, [O Muhammad], concerning Me &#8211; indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided&#8221;. [2:186]</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what is beautiful. Allah loves those who do what is beautiful&#8221; [2:95]</p>

They contain ‘anthocyanosides’ which are phytochemicals that strengthen the skin and help keep it elastic by fortifying the collagen make-up of the epidermis. And remember, frozen berries work just as well as fresh ones and they are less expensive!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Yvonne Maffei shares her homemade anti-wrinkle skincare regimen]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With harsh environmental factors giving our skin a beating all winter long, it’s time to give it a little tender loving care with some intensive natural remedies. Pamper your skin at least once a week with this anti-wrinkle regimen to rehydrate and rejuvenate in time for spring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf9b00;"><strong>Eye area care</strong></span><br />
Whisk an egg white thoroughly and dab around the eyes. Leave on for 20-30 minutes. Rinse with tepid water. The proteins in the egg whites help decrease the appearance of wrinkles and tighten up the skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf9b00;"><strong>Face and neck care</strong></span><br />
<em>Exfoliator</em><br />
Lemons are great exfoliators because of their high acidity. Juice half a lemon and use a cotton ball to dab two tablespoons of the juice around the face. It helps slough off dead skin while also softening it at the same time, making it a great wrinkle fader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Cleanser</em><br />
A combination of honey and castile soap is a great way to hydrate your skin and freshen it at the same time. Honey contains glycolic acid, which is a key ingredient in many over-the-counter skincare products for its wrinkle-fighting capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combine ¹∕₃ cup of each: water or lime juice, raw honey and castile soap (with coconut oil). Apply to face (if you have extra just be sure to use it up within a day or so). The castile soap should make the mixture frothy enough to lather onto face and neck. Remove with a wet wash cloth for an exfoliating effect, or just rinse with cool water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mask</em><br />
Both bananas and yoghurt are incredibly moisturising. Mix them together and they make for a super face mask. Combine one mashed banana with one tablespoon of whole-milk yoghurt in a bowl. Spread small amounts on face and neck until fully covered. Leave on for twenty minutes, then remove with a washcloth and warm water. Follow up with an all-natural toner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, another mask consisting of one mashed avocado with a teaspoon of raw honey will do wonders for skin in need of repair. Both ingredients are excellent at repairing skin damage. Simply massage the mix onto face and neck. Leave for 10-15 minutes and then rinse with cool water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf9b00;"><strong>Toner</strong></span><br />
For dry winter skin, apple cider vinegar is a surprisingly good ingredient to finish off a daily or nightly skincare regimen. It contains alpha hydroxy acids which prevent the build-up of dead skin that lead to the creation of fine lines and wrinkles. Mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with four tablespoons of water. Using a cotton ball, simply dab a small amount all over face after each cleansing. Do not rinse. Follow up with moisturiser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A small aloe plant is as valuable in a kitchen as it is on your vanity table. Cut one small leaf at its fattest part and squeeze out the rubbery flesh, known as the aloe vera. Rub all over face or directly to wrinkles to help repair damaged cells and smooth out any wrinkles. Rinse with cool water and follow up with moisturiser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf9b00;"><strong>Moisturiser</strong></span><br />
Moisturisers don’t have to be complicated, but they do need to work. Two of the best ones for the face and neck are coconut oil and olive oil. Measure one tablespoon of either oil and massage into face and neck. Add a dash of Vitamin E oil around the eyes, which is a powerful antioxidant with skin-repair qualities. Blot out any excess oil with tissues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Kanika Aggarwal shares the recipes for two of her favourite homemade soaps.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before I wandered into the world of homemade products, I always wondered, &#8220;Why would someone opt for homemade products, especially for something as basic as soap?&#8221; Was it really too much trouble to go out there and pick up a pack of soap at the supermarket or the chemists? And in the grand scheme of things, soap was not really expensive either, so saving money by making homemade would be out of the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I eventually made my way to the other side when I realised that I didn&#8217;t know all of the ingredients that were being poured into my bath. Once I realised that most of the ingredients were synthetic and were harming my skin more than benefiting it, I knew I had to make a change. Making my own soap seemed like the perfect solution. An added bonus was that making a homemade soap is neither difficult nor time-consuming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are recipes for two of my favourite homemade soaps &#8211; almond rose soap, which is a fragrant soap that gently cleanses, and cinnamon soap, which is a rich and spicy soap that nourishes your skin. Made with absolutely natural ingredients, these soaps will benefit your spirits as well as your skin!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Almond Rose Soap</strong></p>

<em><strong>Ingredients:</strong></em><br />
• 2 tbsp dried red rose petals<br />
• 8 oz. pure soap flakes<br />
• ²∕₃ cup boiling water<br />
• ½ cup rose water<br />
• 2 tbsp ground almonds<br />
• 9 drops geranium essential oil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Pound the rose petals with a mortar and pestle. In a large bowl, combine the ground petals, soap, and water and stir until smooth. If the soap starts to solidify, place the bowl over near-boiling water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
2. Stir in the rose water and ground almonds. Allow to cool. Stir in the essential oil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
3. Shape the mixture into six balls and flatten them slightly. Allow the soap to harden between sheets of wax paper. Keep unused soap in a cool, dark place until needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<em><strong>Ingredients:</strong></em><br />
• 2 pounds leftover soap<br />
• 1 tbsp spring water<br />
• 1 tsp glycerin<br />
• ½ tsp cinnamon essential oil<br />
• 1 tbsp sweet orange essential oil<br />
• 10 drops clove bud essential oil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Coarsely grate the scraps of soap into a large mixing bowl. Add the spring water, glycerin, and essential oils. Mix well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
2. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and allow it to stand for about 15 minutes, until the soap is slightly soft and pliable. If your soap scraps are fairly new, they may be soft and not need much softening time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
3. Scoop the mixture up by the handful and press or roll it into small balls. Compress it tightly. Place on wax paper. Allow the soap balls to dry and harden for a day or two.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Many of us have stressful, hectic lifestyles and this can often have an impact on our hair - resulting in hair loss. SISTERS' Reyh]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of the natural remedies are made up of common ingredients, which you&#8217;re already likely to have at home. Some of the common ones are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar</strong></span></p>
<p>The vinegar gently cleanses the scalp and maintains the PH balance of the hair, which helps to  accelerate hair growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the vinegar diluted in warm water as a final rinse after washing your hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #7b32c9;">READ MORE: <a href="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/get-gorgeous-part-2-apple-cider-vinegar/" target="_blank">Get Gorgeous with Apple Cider Vinegar</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Considered a health miracle by many, apple cider vinegar is also amazing for your skin and hair. SISTERS’ Reyhana Ismail looks at some ways you can add it to your beauty routine, as well as other health benefits.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eggs</p>
<p>Eggs contain high levels of protein, which help in the formation of new hair. They are also rich in sulphur, zinc, iron, selenium, phosphorous and iodine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take the white of one egg, add 1 teaspoon of olive oil and honey to it and mix well to form a smooth paste. Apply to your hair and leave for 20 minutes. Rinse with cool water and shampoo it off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Onion Juice</strong></span></p>
<p>Onion juice is rich in sulphur, which boosts collagen production in the tissues and helps in the re-growth of hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a red onion or shallot and chop into small pieces. Squeeze out the juice then apply to your scalp carefully. Leave on for 15 minutes, then rinse off with a mild shampoo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Cayenne Pepper</strong></span></p>
<p>Cayenne pepper stimulates hair growth and prevents the thinning of hair. It contains Capsaicin, which when applied on the scalp causes the nerves to activate and increase the blood flow to the scalp. This results in the increased absorption of nutrients and better hair growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mix 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper powder with 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Apply to the scalp where thinning is most prominent. Wash off with cool water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Green Tea</strong></span></p>
<p>Green tea is rich in antioxidants, which prevent hair loss and boost hair growth.</p>
<p>Apply warm green tea all over your scalp. Cover and leave for an hour. Rinse off with cool water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Garlic</strong></span></p>
<p>Garlic is well known as a home remedy for reducing the shedding of hair as it boosts the regeneration of new hair and promotes scalp circulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boil a few cloves of crushed garlic in olive oil or coconut oil and rub in to your scalp. Wash off properly. Use this treatment thrice a week for best results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>ESSENTIAL OIL TREATMENTS FOR HAIR GROWTH</strong></span></p>
<p>Regular massage with essential oils promotes hair growth, reduces hair loss and split ends. This makes your hair softer and smoother. After massaging your hair with any essential oil, wrap your head with a hot towel or a shower cap. This allows the pores of the scalp to open up and helps the oils penetrate the scalp better. It also stimulates the scalp and improves blood circulation, thereby boosting hair growth. Regular hot oil treatments also reduce dandruff and add shine to your hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Argan Oil</strong></span></p>
<p>Often referred to as ‘liquid pure gold’, Argan oil works magic on thinning hair as it improves hair quality by moisturising the follicles and enhancing hair growth. It loosens dry skin cells around hair follicles and stimulates the scalp to secrete more oil, to keep your hair healthy and shiny.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Massage a small amount into your hair and leave overnight. Wash off with a mild shampoo. Repeat once or twice per week for silky, smooth, glossy, irresistible hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Coconut Oil</strong></span></p>
<p>Rich in potassium, coconut oil keeps your scalp healthy; promotes the growth of new hair and repairs damaged hair. It also reduces dandruff, hair breakage and hair loss. Coconut oil is also used as a pre-conditioning hair treatment for damaged hair. It acts as a moisturiser and strengthens the hair shaft from the root, thus preventing breakage. It keeps the scalp well-nourished and moisturised. Use coconut hot oil treatment for effective results.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/lets-get-gorgeous-part-1/">For simple, fuss-free ways to enhance your beauty regime, look no further than your kitchen or bathroom cupboards! You’ll be amazed at just how much these basic ingredients can</a> do. SISTERS’ Reyhana Ismail looks at some of the benefits of coconut oil.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Lavender Oil</strong></span></p>
<p>Lavender oil is widely used for curing alopecia &#8211; thinning of hair and hair loss.  It also reduces sleeplessness and stress. It is used in many spa treatments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prepare an essential oil mixture by combining lavender oil, rosemary oil, thyme oil and jojoba oil in equal proportions. Apply to your scalp and cover with a shower cap. Leave on for an hour. Wash and rinse thoroughly thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Jojoba Oil</strong></span></p>
<p>Jojoba oils stimulates hair growth by improving the blood circulation and moisturising the hair follicles. It also repairs dry and damaged hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Flaxseed Oil</strong></span></p>
<p>Flaxseeds are a rich source of essential fatty acids which help to transform dry, damaged and brittle hair to healthy and shiny hair. The omega 3 fatty acids in the oil promote healthy hair growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Olive Oil</strong></span></p>
<p>Olive oil helps preventing as well as curing hair loss. It stimulates the formation of new hair. Regular use of olive oil prevents the formation of DTH hormone and thus facilitates hair growth. Rich in antioxidants, it is beneficial for overall hair health. Olive oil also acts as a natural conditioner by making your hair soft and silky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Include olive oil in your daily diet, and use as a pre-shampoo treatment. It can also be mixed with lavender, sage and rosemary oil for a hot oil treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7b32c9;"><strong>Castor Oil</strong></span></p>
<p>Castor oil is one of the most beneficial oils that can make your hair grow faster, stronger, and lustrous. It is claimed to be the best natural treatment for hair growth that boosts hair growth while reducing possible bald patches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warm up castor oil and apply to scalp, massaging well. Wrap your hair in a warm, moist towel and leave on for at least 20 minutes before you shower. The oil is very sticky so you can add a little lemon juice to it to make it easier to manage. Apply twice a week for best results.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ayshabibi Hafesji encourages us to experiment with turmeric.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turmeric is a powdery, bright yellow spice, initially made from a root plant found in the ginger family. It has a very bitter taste but a vibrant yellow-orange colour. Turmeric originates from India and China has been used for many, many years as a culinary spice, food preservative, herbal remedy and a colouring agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it is mostly used in curries, don’t be afraid to use it for medicinal and beauty purposes as well. Studies have now found turmeric to have powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, which help to combat various health problems. It is so commonly used that it has been nicknamed the aspirin of India and is found in every Indian family’s first aid kit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nutritionally, turmeric is rich in fibre, iron, potassium, manganese and vitamin B6. However, the main ingredient that causes its beneficial properties is curcumin, which has been found to be a great immunity booster. It is also used in various drugs and medicines, so we know that it helps the body against some illnesses:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>• Asthma and peptic ulcers by protecting the gastrointestinal lining: </strong></span><br />
Mix 1 tsp of turmeric powder in a cup of warm milk and drink three times a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #ffcc00;"> <strong>• Sore throats: </strong></span><br />
Mix ½ tsp of turmeric and ½ tsp of salt in a glass of warm water and gargle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>• Wounds and cuts: </strong></span><br />
Turmeric is also a great antiseptic &#8211; simply apply directly on wounds and cuts to stop blood flow and reduce the risk of infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turmeric is not only best used as a healing agent but for many beauty treatments too. For many generations, women in South Asia have used turmeric in their daily skincare regimes. Due to the bright yellow pigment and its powerful chemical properties, turmeric is used in some facials and skincare products. It helps to clear up blemishes, acne, dark spots and hyperpigmentation, as well as brightening up the skin to give it a healthy glow. Simply mix equal portions of turmeric and gram flour, make a paste with water or milk and apply to the face or body. Leave for 10-15 minutes and wash off with warm water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To treat oily skin, mix turmeric with sandalwood and orange juice. Apply to the face, wait for it to dry and wash off with warm water. Your skin will be left looking cleansed and dewy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some women, facial hair can be a real battle; we are always trying to find new ways to remove those unwanted hairs. Now you can try to reduce its growth with turmeric. Make a paste with water and apply to the face either every day or on alternate days to see the difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when you have a cut or need a refreshing facial, try out the bright yellow powder which doesn’t need to be restricted to your cooking, but can be used for your health and beauty too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tick tock goes the clock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s 5:24 in the afternoon and I stare into my bathroom mirror as I expertly apply smooth and even strokes of foundation, being careful to conceal any blemishes left over from years-ago teenage acne angst and some blemishes which, unfortunately, chose to stick around a little longer and regularly haunt me at the ripe old age of 36.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Tick tock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It’s 5:26 and my eyes are wide open along with my mouth, for some strange reason, as I curl and darken my eyelashes. I reward my efforts with a few sultry bats of said lashes and am pleased with the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Tick tock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It’s 5:29 and I smile as I apply my favorite shade of lipstick, a deep plum hue which compliments my dark eyes and fair skin. I admire the effect before finishing the look with a subtle hint of lip liner. These lips practically beg to be kissed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Tick tock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It’s 5:30 and with a final sweep of blush and another quick glance at my reflection and fluff for my perfectly coifed hair I’m ready for my husband’s 5:35 return from work whereupon I will reward his day-long toils with a primped and prettied up wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sit and wait. Tick tock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now it’s 5:33 and there’s the Adhan, coming straight from my smartphone application so courteously reminding me of the time for Asr prayer. Okay. No problem. I’ll quickly pray and still be ready to greet my husband when he walks through the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tick tock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s 5:34 and I’m back in front of the bathroom mirror splashing water on my face and up my nose and in my mouth and on my hair, a ritual I perform five times a day in preparation for my prayers. I quickly slip into a hijab, hastily pulling my hair into a sloppy ponytail in the process, and throw an old black abaya over my head. I bow my head and cross my hands over my chest. “Allahu Akbar,” I say and launch into my recitations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Tick tock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s 5:40 and, prayer complete, I rip off my hijab and prayer garb, thankful I finished my salah before my husband’s arrival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tick tock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s 5:41 and now my husband is coming through the door. I saunter on over to meet him, a small smile on my lips as I get ready to launch myself into his arms with all the confidence that perfect hair and makeup afford us women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tick tock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s still 5:41 and I suddenly catch a quick but horrifying glance of myself in a nearby mirror. My previously immaculately styled hair is now showing minor but unmistakable signs of hijab head! Oh the horror! And my once perfectly applied makeup &#8211; including the sexy smoky eye effect which I only just recently mastered after several YouTube tutorials &#8211; is now a not-so-sexy mess running in black streaks down my cheeks! Finally, last but sadly not least, my plum lipstick is smudged and my previously perfect pout now exists only in my memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Tick tock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s 5:42 and I’m standing in front my eagerly awaited husband who’s just walked through the door. My face is a mess. My hair is flat, decidedly unfluffed and a little bit damp. And me? Am I the primped and prettied-up wife I was aiming for? Definitely not!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
So here’s my rant: How are Muslim hijabi women &#8211; who are taught the virtue of covering their beauty to the outside world and unrelated men and only displaying said beauty for the enjoyment of their husbands &#8211; supposed to achieve that look when we are called on five times a day to douse our faces and heads with water?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let me say this right off the bat before I go any farther. I believe in prayer and I participate in prayer five times a day every day Alhamdulillah and insha Allah this will always be the case in my life. But as a convert, particularly one who in her past life was accustomed to indulging in the latest eyeshadow shades and trendiest hairstyles, it was difficult for me to put all that aside, don the headscarf and discard my face paint. But, Alhamdullah, I did it! So when I learned that it was a good idea to save all of that beautification for the privacy of my home and for the enjoyment of my husband, I was totally down. That is, until I got down to the realities of what it means to be pretty at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s admit it. Home is not where we are used to looking our best and to be honest I just feel strange walking around my house in full dress, makeup and my hair done up just so. Home to many of us means ponytails, comfy Yoga pants and no mascara let alone lipstick. But it seems now that I’m a hijabi I’m supposed to glam it up at home when all I want to do as soon as I walk through my door is yank off my headscarf and all the other layers of clothing I wear and put on my comfiest and, truth be told, not most attractive clothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what’s a girl to do? Well, be warned, I haven’t figured that out yet, but I’ll tell you what I’ve tried so far. My first thought was I could have a cute hairstyle at home so I’ve spent countless hours in the hairdresser’s chair trying to achieve the perfect haircut that is not only stylish and easy to maintain but one that works with hijab. I’ve tried sideswept bangs, which nicely frame my face and bring out my dark eyes, but those bangs soon fall pitifully flat after they’ve been pushed back on my head to be tucked under my headscarf during prayer. And sadly, once they’ve been flattened they never seem to bounce back into place. Next I’ve tried to perfect the chic ponytail look, with nary a hair out of place and a high ponytail perfectly positioned in the middle of my head with its “tail” glossily trailing down my back.  But let’s face it: a ponytail is a ponytail no matter how hard I try to convince myself otherwise and  it simply does not convey the same “sexy mussed hair” look that I want so desperately to achieve as does loosely flowing locks.  And what about cute clothes at home? Well, no matter how much I want to achieve that look I just can’t sacrifice comfort for style. No matter how great I look in my skinny jeans and fitted T-shirts I want no part of them once I’m inside and ensconced on the couch. Not to mention that isn’t the best attire for cooking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So amidst all this hair and makeup drama and feeling ready to throw in the towel and surrender myself to being covered outside the home and looking not much better inside the home I finally had a revelation! There is a time each month, a span of three to four days, where I am not called on to pray, where I don’t have to assault my makeup and hair masterpieces with splashes of water. What could it be, what could it be? All together now ladies &#8211; MENSES!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lo and behold I had found my salvation! Several days all in a row where I was free to indulge my hair and makeup fantasies without threat of water and hijab head! Free to bat my mascara-laden lashes at my husband as he walked through the door! Free to pucker up my lipstick-stained lips as I offered them up for his welcome-home kiss! Free to…wait! How could I forget? Menses may mean all-out glamour at home but we all know what it doesn’t mean, don’t we? No bedroom passion as a reward for all that beautification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
What the…? Oh forget it! Pass me my Yoga pants and ponytail holder.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Try these recipes to exfoliate your skin, getting rid of dead skin cells and revealing a fresh new you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>1. KITCHEN PANTRY BODY SCRUB</strong></span><br />
<em>No need to head to the store for those pricey exfoliants and body scrubs &#8211; head to your pantry instead! </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2289" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_38392132web-1024x1024.jpg" alt="shutterstock_38392132(web)" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_38392132web-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_38392132web-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_38392132web-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_38392132web-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_38392132web-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_38392132web.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:  </strong><br />
•  1/4 cup coffee grounds<br />
•  1/8 cup light olive oil<br />
•  1/2 tsp. vanilla extract<br />
•  1/2 tsp. raw cane sugar</p>
<p><strong>Preparation: </strong><br />
Mix all ingredients with a fork. During your shower, apply the scrub all of over your body in a circular, massaging motion. Work the mixture deeply into your rough areas like elbows and heels. When finished, cleanse as usual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Because this mixture contains oil and should be applied during a shower, your floor could become very slippery. Be sure to use a mat to prevent slipping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>SUGARY YOGHURT SCRUB</strong></span></p>
<p><em>This recipe is versatile- if you don’t want to use sugar, you can replace it with ground corn meal, rice powder or even oatmeal for sensitive skin types. The results will be the same &#8211; skin that has been exfoliated and moisturised in one application.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2290" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_133710806-1024x1024.jpg" alt="shutterstock_133710806" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_133710806-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_133710806-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_133710806-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_133710806-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_133710806-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_133710806.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:  </strong><br />
•  2 tb. whole milk yogurt<br />
•  1 tb. raw cane or turbinado sugar<br />
<strong>Preparation:</strong><br />
Mix ingredients to form a paste. Gently rub into skin in a circular motion, starting from the neck or chin and working upwards towards the forehead but not around the eyes.<br />
Continue this for several minutes before rinsing with cool water.<br />
Follow with a homemade toner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>CHOCOLATE FACE MASK</strong></span></p>
<p><em>What a delight chocolate is for our taste buds, but few realize that it also nourishes, moisturizes and sloughs off dead skin. After applying this mixture, you’ll be amazed at how your skin glows!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:  </strong><br />
•  1/3 cup cocoa<br />
•  1/4 cup of honey<br />
•  2 egg yolks<br />
• 3 teaspoons oatmeal (optional)<br />
<strong>Preparation: </strong><br />
Mix all ingredients well. Apply on the face, gently massaging so that oatmeal can start exfoliating the dead skin cell layer. Leave it on for about 20 minutes and rinse off with lukewarm water.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Perfect for giving hair a polished look, hair straighteners are ideal for removing unwanted curls and frizz. Here are some tips on]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firstly, if you don&#8217;t already own one, decide which size works best for your hair. The general rule is that the shorter and thinner your hair is, the narrower the straighteners you need. Wider straighteners are best for longer, thicker hair:</p>
<p>1/2&#8243; mini iron: Ideal for pixie cuts and fringes (bangs)</p>
<p>1&#8243; flat iron: Best for shot, fine hair</p>
<p>1 1/4&#8243; flat iron: Great for hair that&#8217;s shoulder length and medium-thickness</p>
<p>1 1/2&#8243; flat iron: Perfect for thick, coarse, curly hair and hair that&#8217;s longer than shoulder length</p>
<p>2&#8243; flat iron: This is ideal for thick, very long hair</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are different types of straighteners, made with different materials:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf087c;"><em><strong>Ceramic:</strong></em> </span>Ceramic plates evenly distribute heat and are less likely to burn the hair. Try to avoid ceramic coated plates though as they can often chip and therefore snag on hair, so it&#8217;s better to use plates made fully of ceramic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf087c;"><em><strong>Tourmaline:</strong></em></span> This is a crystalline mineral which is used to coat the plates of a flat iron. It generally makes hair shinier, straighter and a lot less frizzy than the other options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf087c;"><strong><em>Titanium:</em> </strong></span>These heat up faster than ceramic and are less likely to cause heat damage if used correctly, as long as they are not left on the hair for too long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf087c;"><strong>Preparing your hair:</strong></span></p>
<p>Look for shampoos and conditioners that claim to have straightening and/or moisturising properties, as these are specially formulated to create sleek hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pat your hair dry after washing, rather than ruffling harshly, as this helps to keep frizz at a minimum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst your hair is still wet, use a thermal protection serum or hair treatment. This is best on wet hair as the moisture allows it to spread more evenly. Comb through after applying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Products containing Argan oil or coconut oil are great for deep conditioning, and products with silicone will help keep hair straight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="row article-title-content">
<div class="col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>For simple, fuss-free ways to enhance your beauty regime, look no further than your kitchen or bathroom cupboards! You’ll be amazed at just how much these basic ingredients can do. SISTERS’ Reyhana Ismail looks at some of the benefits of coconut oil.</em></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blow dry your hair, or if you have time, allow to dry naturally. Your hair must be fully dry when straightening otherwise it will be prone to damage. Point the hair dryer downward whilst blow-drying. This downward motion away from your roots encourages your hair to dry straight. Set your hair dryer on the lowest heat setting. If you have particularly frizzy hair, drying your hair on a lower heat setting for a longer period of time will prevent your hair from puffing up as you dry it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf087c;"><strong>Straightening:</strong></span></p>
<p>Plug in your straighteners and allow to heat up. The thicker your hair, the higher the temperature should be. However, do not set the heat any higher than 365°F. Hair burns at a temperature of 451°F, the same as paper. For finer hair, keep the setting to between 300°F and 325°F.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separate your hair into several sections and pin out of the way. Hair going through the straighteners need to be approximately 1 to 2 inches thick only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the straightener as close to the roots as possible, clamp the iron down and run it down the length of your hair. Use a straightening comb in front of the straightener to detangle and help the hair sit flat while the straightener does its job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t hold the straightener in any one place for too long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work your way through the sections, unpinning as you go along and moving the straightened sections of hair out of the way. It is generally easier to work your way around your head, from one side to the other, so that the straightened hair and non-straightened hair don&#8217;t get mixed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After straightening, blow dry your hair on the coldest setting, again going downwards from the roots. This will help to set the hair. You can then use a hairspray or anti-frizz serum containing silicone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf087c;"><em><strong>Tips:</strong></em></span></p>
<p>To get more volume, flat iron your hair just at the roots, going upwards, towards the ceiling</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get natural looking waves by twisting 1 inch sections of hair tightly then running your straighteners over it. You can also braid your hair and run the straighteners over the braid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get tighter curls, wrap a section or hair around your finger then pin to your scalp. Repeat until you&#8217;ve pinned all your hair up. Press each roll flat with your straighteners then unpin. Spritz with a little hairspray to finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hair straighteners can be cleaned using a damp towel, or a face wipe. A soft cloth soaked in lemon juice also cleans well, as does a thin mixtur of baking soda and water.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="page" title="Page 50">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this facial treatment since I was a teen. It effectively opens and cleans the pores but also relaxes you at the same time. The fragrance of dried herbs is wonderful. I have yet to discover a more soothing, inexpensive and healthy way to achieve such positive results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #846799;"><strong>Items Required:</strong></span></p>
<p>• Large, deep bowl</p>
<p>• 1 gm dried lavender</p>
<p>• 1 gm dried/fresh orange peel</p>
<p>• 1 gm dried/fresh lemon peel</p>
<p>• 7 gm dried eucalyptus leaves (optional)</p>
<p>• 3 gm dried rosemary</p>
<p>• 1 large towel</p>
<p>• Medium-size spoon</p>
<p>• Timer</p>
<p>• 1 litre water</p>
<p>• Cotton balls or pads</p>
<p>• Orange/rose water (found in most ethnic or Mediterranean markets)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #846799;"><strong>Directions</strong></span><br />
1. Arrange the bowl on a table where you can sit on a chair and lean over the bowl comfortably. Add all of the dried herbs to the empty bowl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>2. Set aside the large towel ready for use. Place the spoon nearby, as well as the timer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>3. In the pan or teakettle, bring water to a boil. Immediately pour the boiling water into the bowl. Stir the herbs around in the water. Set the timer for twenty minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. While the water is still hot and steaming, open up the towel completely and place it behind your head. Lean over the bowl, but keep a safe enough distance so that the steam doesn’t hurt your face. You should be able to breathe comfortably and feel enough heat for your face to sweat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Try to stay in this position for a maximum of twenty minutes or as long as you feel comfortable. Remove yourself from the bowl and rinse your face with fresh cool water. Using a cotton ball or pad, pat your entire face and neck with rose water or orange blossom water to tone, freshen and tighten the skin’s pores.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Kanika Aggarwal explains the Shari’ah rulings on a variety of issues surrounding women’s grooming, beautification and adornmen]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In much of the modern Muslim world, women are taught that everything that falls under the category of beautification and adornment is prohibited by the Shari&#8217;ah. On the contrary, when it comes to worldly matters, the maxim goes, &#8220;Everything is allowed unless specified.&#8221; The Shari&#8217;ah does not prohibit a woman from beautifying herself. Women are asked to do so within the guidelines of Islam in order to protect themselves from any potential harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since by default everything is allowed, listed below are some matters that come with certain Islamic guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #77bfbf;"><strong>Cutting hair</strong></span><br />
Muslim women are encouraged to take care of their hair. Abu Hurayrah (RA) reported the Prophet (SAW) as saying: &#8220;Whoever has hair should honour it&#8221; <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Abu Dawud)</em></span>. A Muslim woman should treat her hair with appropriate products such as shampoo, conditioner, serums and oils.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is allowed to lengthen or shorten her hair, depending on her own liking. However, she is not allowed to imitate the haircut of the opposite gender or shave it off completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #77bfbf;"><strong>Wearing a wig/hair extensions</strong></span><br />
Our Shari&#8217;ah does not allow a woman to wear a wig or add hair extensions, even to please her husband, because of the prohibition against adding artificial hair to original hair. Abu Hurayrah (RA) reported that the Prophet (SAW) said: “Allah has cursed the woman who adds false hair and the woman who has this done, and the woman who tattoos and the women who has this done.”<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Shaykh al &#8216;Uthaymeen released a fatwa expressing that if a woman doesn&#8217;t have any hair on her head due to sickness, e.g. if she is bald or has patchiness, then it is allowed for her to use a wig. This is because in her case, it is to remove blemishes. He based his fatwa on the example of the Prophet (SAW) who allowed a man who had his nose cut off during a battle to wear a fake nose of gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #77bfbf;"><strong>Plastic surgery</strong></span><br />
Continuing from above, in Islam, beautification is not the same as removing a blemish. Plastic surgery is allowed if the matter is that of removing a blemish, such as a crooked nose or the removal of a birth mark. Then the scholars consider no harm in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #77bfbf;"><strong>Shortening eyebrows and removing facial hair</strong></span><br />
This is a widely discussed matter in our Shari&#8217;ah. Muslim women are not allowed to remove or pluck eyebrow hairs. &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (SAW) cursed the women who plucked hair and those who were employed to pluck the eyebrows.&#8221; <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Abu Dawud)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is a difference of opinion amongst scholars on trimming or clipping these hairs. Scholars say that it is best to avoid this act. However, if a woman has some obtrusive hairs near her eyebrows, such as stray hairs or linked eyebrows, which are a problem and embarrassment for her, she may remove them. This is based on the example of &#8216;A’isha (RA), when she was approached by the young wife of Abu Ishaq who wished to remove her facial hairs in order to look beautiful for her husband. She advised her to do so <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(At-Tabarani)</em></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exception is also granted in the case of hair that is uncommon or unusual for women to have, such as what grows on a part of the face wherein women usually do not have hair growth. This includes moustaches or cheek hair; there is no harm in removing that type of hair. By extension, it is also allowed for a woman to remove hairs from other parts of her body such as her thighs, arms and legs. There is no prohibition regarding these acts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #77bfbf;"><strong>Nail polish and letting the fingernails grow</strong></span><br />
There is no prohibition on using nail polish. However, it must be removed before ablution because it prevents water from reaching the nails. Thus, I always encourage women to wear nail polish during their menstruation or postpartum days, when ablution is not an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Letting the fingernails grow is against the <em>fitrah</em> (natural instinct) and the sunnah of the Prophet (SAW). He said: &#8220;From the acts of nature are five: circumcision, removing pubic hairs, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails and plucking the hair from under the armpits&#8221;<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Bukhari and Muslim)</em></span>. Additionally, it is not allowed to leave them for more than forty nights. This is based on the hadith of Anas (RA): &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (SAW) set a time limit for us for trimming the moustache, trimming nails, removing armpit hairs and removing pubic hairs. They cannot be left for more than forty nights&#8221;<span style="color: #999999;"> <em>(Muslim)</em>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #77bfbf;"><strong>Using perfume outside of the house</strong></span><br />
Lastly, it is recommended for a woman to wear perfume for pleasing her husband. However, women are not allowed to use perfume when they go out. This is because the Prophet (SAW) prohibited women from using any kind of incense when leaving their house: “‘If a woman puts on perfume and passes by people so that they can smell her fragrance, then she is such and such,’ and he spoke sternly &#8211; meaning an adulteress&#8221; <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Abu Dawud)</em>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #77bfbf;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><br />
Remember dear sisters, everything that falls under the category of beautification and adornment is allowed except for the matters mentioned above. Also, remember that these guidelines have been placed by your Creator, your Rabb &#8211; Allah (SWT), in order to protect you from the evils of the society, not to impinge on your freedom. Please consult your local scholars if you have any doubts regarding these matters. Happy beautifying!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[SHUKR’s Head Designer Tabassum Siddiqui gives your look a lift by making use of what you have right at home.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may already be familiar with the term ‘recycling’ and probably dutifully separate your plastic bottles, glass and paper from your trash and send them off to be transformed into some other useful product, giving them a new lease of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a great concept that works for your home, but what if you applied that same principle to some of the clothes that you own but haven’t worn in ages. You know the ones that are stacked in piles or shoved at the back of your closet and haven’t seen the light of day? Or the clothes that you love but have unfortunately gone out of style? Do we toss them out like the daily trash?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
How about we give them a second chance and ‘upcycle’ them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #069c9c;"><strong>‘Upcycle’?</strong></span><br />
‘Upcycling’ is one of those terms that hasn’t quite made it into the dictionaries just yet but refers to the process of taking a material beyond it’s original usefulness and making it more valuable and desirable. And this term perfectly describes the process of reinventing neglected or out-of-style items in your wardrobe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People who are pretty crafty with a needle and thread and are very creative know that practically any old piece of clothing has the potential to become a new couture item. This reminds me of my high school days: taking clothes from vintage stores and second-hand shops, cutting them up, piecing them together with other clothes, and dying them to make them my own. Hand creating new styles was the only way for me and a lot of teenagers my age to maintain our individuality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That idea still applies today and even more so as our spending limits have drastically reduced and most of us are keeping our wallets snapped shut. Who can afford to keep up with fashion trends or new seasonal outfits? Taking clothes that you already own, but don’t wear as often as you’d like and reinventing them is a great way to add ‘new’ pieces to your wardrobe, not to mention a great creative exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an added bonus, repurposing old clothes and fabrics even if they are curtains or pillowcases and making them into something else is one way to be be truly ‘green’ and eco-conscious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #069c9c;"><strong>Creativity unleashed</strong></span><br />
Even if you don’t know the first thing about sewing, you can always partner up with someone who does; make it an afternoon or weekend event with your family or girlfriends. Why not host an ‘upcyclying party’ and have everyone bring in a few pieces of clothing they want to upcycle and trade amongst each other. You will definitely open up an infinite amount of possiblities and could even be in process of making some new trends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decontruct dresses, T-shirts and jeans. Piece together 2 wrap scarves of different colors to have a bi-color hijab. Bead or embellish a plain top. Dye some of your pieces with new colors or try your hand at an ombré dye effect that shows one color blending into another. Take adult clothing and make it into children’s clothing. The ideas really are endless!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just because it sounds like a home craft project doesn’t mean it has to look like one. These newly reinvented pieces can stand up to any runway look as long as you take care and finish them well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #069c9c;"><strong>The ‘upcycle box’</strong></span><br />
I usually keep a large plastic box at home where I toss clothes, fabric, embellishments, and other odds and ends I want to upcycle. When I get a free weekend or even a few hours, I will sit down with my ‘to-be-upcycled’ clothes and decide what parts of each garment I want to save and think about what I could make out of them. I may sit down with some patterns, look at magazine pictures, or even start sketching out some possibilities. Maybe I like the cut of a certain top, but now want to make it into a cute short sleeve top to wear at home. Or I may like the sleeves on one top and want to change them for the sleeves on another top and play with the contrasting prints and fabrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My latest upcycling project was to give new life to a silk and cashmere sweaterdress that I have. I had bought it hoping that it would be long enough for my tall frame but unfortunately the sizing was wrong. Instead of hitting my ankles it hit mid-calf. What I was hoping for was a long ankle length sweaterdress and what I got was a long sweater &#8211; I wasn’t thrilled. I didn’t want this expensive sweater to just sit in my closet and to return it would have cost more than the sweater. I tried to wear it with trousers, but the outfit looked odd and bulky. So I decided to get out my cutting shears and do something about it. And oh yes, when upcycling, do not be afraid to cut up expensive material. That is part of the thrill of reinventing your clothes, to see what you can make out of them in the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best thing that I could do with a sweaterdress with an awkward length was to make it into a tunic length and give the sweaterdress a Trapeze cut so that I could wear trousers underneath. I decided to make this a handsewing project, given the delicate nature of the knit and because I love the process of sewing by hand. If you are working with knits in any of your upcycyling projects, you can use a sewing machine if you have the right needles, thread, and experience with knits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I cut the sweaterdress to just below my knees, then I cut open the side seams. I then made side seam panels out of the hem that I had cut off the dress. I stitched the panels into the side seams with overcast stitches or a zigzag chain stitch that would give it stretch and flexibility. After sewing in the panels, I stitched the hem using a blindstitch hem. Believe me, I tried the top on several times before it was actually finished because I was just so anxious to see how my project was progressing. I was so happy that I didn’t have to give it away or toss it, I just had to give it a new look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My new garment is very feminine and subtle with a V-neck, straight slim sleeves, then it opens into a swinging Trapeze cut and hits just below the knees. The sweater doesn’t have a wide, tent effect, but hangs from my body with small fluid folds. To finish it off, I will be adding a large organic deconstructed rosette to the shoulder like a 1940’s corsage made out of all of the scraps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
However, I wore the top out recently without the corsage because I was so anxious to wear it. The first sister I happened to run into kept staring at my sweater while talking to me and then cut me off mid-sentence and asked me if I was selling my top!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thrilled! This goes to show you that repurposing your wardrobe can lead to some interesting results. So, what will you be upcycling today?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to look beautiful? Would you like to de-stress? Do you want to relax, unwind and have an enjoyable time with your girlfriends? If you answered yes to the questions, then what you need is a ‘Pamper Party’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>What is a pamper party?</strong></span><br />
It is a gathering where you receive beauty treatments in a private cosy setting. It is commonly organised at a hostess’s home, transforming it into a salon. Friends and family get together with some light snacks and drinks and take turns to have some ‘me time’ – for treatments as simple as a manicure to an invigorating massage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Who it is ideal for?</strong></span><br />
Pamper parties can be thrown for any reason &#8211; from just having a friendly get-together, wanting some ‘me time’, to something more significant like a pre-wedding treat. The most common reasons for having a pamper party are before/after having a baby, a post-Ramadan treat, approaching Eid, a Mothers and Daughters treat, or even husbands wanting to treat their wives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>What are the requirements and preparations?</strong></span><br />
It doesn’t take much to organise a pamper party. The most important thing is to prepare to enjoy yourself. Preparations are as easy as these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Call up people that may be interested and up for it (at least 4-6 people).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Call a therapist or a salon that provides mobile treatment. Get all the details needed to make a decision. Different companies have different specifications and criteria for available treatments. Enquire about the price, duration of treatments, minimum number of people and call out fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Choose a location for your party. The most common choice is at home (yours or maybe a family or friend’s). Alternatively you may book a few rooms in a hotel or a small venue hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases you would need to let the salon know roughly how many treatments you will want on that day. This does not have to be exact but the more precise you are about your needs, the better they will be able to handle them. It may be a good idea to take a small deposit from your guests that can be redeemed against their treatment on the day. This reduces the chance of guests failing to turn up after confirming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #800080;"><strong>What happens during the party?</strong></span><br />
The hostess provides a room or private area for the therapist(s) to carry out the treatments for her guests. This is to ensure maximum relaxation and enjoyment for the guest, otherwise noise and talking can make the session feel rushed and defeat the purpose of the treatment. The therapist turns this area into a temporary haven and the guests take turns to receive their treatment(s). The others waiting their turn simply enjoy the social company like any other party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>How can sisters enjoy it and have a good time?</strong></span><br />
In order to enjoy the full benefits of such a party, it is important to think about the little details. Create an ambiance of serenity. Dim the lights and place candles everywhere. Serve light snacks and drinks or maybe order some take away. You may even hold short inspirational talks on topics relevant to Muslim women. It’s paramount that everyone makes the intention of the gathering to be for the sake of Allah (SWT), as looking after your body and mind is an injunction of Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Any treatments that are unsuitable in this setting?</strong></span><br />
One treatment that is best left for the salon is a body wrap as they can be quite messy and tricky at home. Other than that, almost all pampering treatments can be successfully carried out by a professional therapist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>What to avoid?</strong></span><br />
Avoid bringing children if you can. Pamper parties are a must for frazzled moms and especially rewarding for those who never get &#8216;time out&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to look after ourselves for well-being and peace of mind. The condition of our body is central to how we feel physically and psychologically. Thus we should look after our bodies and do so for the sake of Allah (SWT) so that we may get reward for it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Shadiyah Marshall shares her top tips for caring for your skin through the winter months.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The colder months of the year are the harshest on our skin which often becomes pale, dry and dull. In this article, I’ll be giving you some tips on how to crack the cold weather skin care codes with a brief winter skin product guide suited to your budget. Insha Allah, you will be on your way to great winter skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
• Continue to cleanse, tone and moisturise as you would any other time of the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Change your moisturiser; your summer cream should be different to your winter cream. Ideally, use something with Vitamin C and more hydration. Remember that a thicker cream does not mean more hydration, so don’t go and buy Vaseline petroleum jelly for the winter!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Continue to wear SPF (sun protection factor) in the colder months; it’s an year-round endeavour. It doesn’t have to be high, though: you’re looking at SPF 10 – 15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Don’t use harsh exfoliants. It may seem like they are refreshing your skin but actually they are damaging your protective barrier. Instead, use enzyme-based exfoliants which are more gentle or opt for less gritty ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Take some oral supplements: Omegas, multivitamins and vitamin C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[With the weight gain of pregnancy comes the need to adapt our wardrobes. Ummu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan relates how she adapted her own sty]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my first pregnancy, I was lucky; I only started needing to adapt items of clothing from around the five month stage. Being very conservative with money, coupled with the fact that I still wanted to look good throughout pregnancy, I had a task on my hands. I soon realised that the weight increase and ballooning stomach that comes with pregnancy was merely an opportunity to update my looks, and by that, I don’t mean foraging through my husband’s clothes and donning his jumpers and shirts the whole time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my clothes first started to feel tight, I didn’t immediately rush out to buy a whole new wardrobe. When wearing jeans and trousers, I used a pregnancy belt, which allowed me to keep wearing them despite the fact that I could no longer do up their buttons! This meant that I didn’t have to always wear long tops, since the belt just looked like a vest top underneath another top. This layering effect looked quite neat, in fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, I had enough looser tops and tunics from my current wardrobe to keep me going for a while, whilst still allowing me to keep in style. One thing I did find it worthwhile to purchase quite early on, however, was lingerie. After the extenders I purchased were no longer adequate, I decided to look at the maternity ranges. I soon became frustrated when I found that most maternity lines were highly unflattering, so instead of using my pregnancy as an excuse to adopt the granny-style, I measured myself at various stages and bought from regular ranges, which gave me a much better range of choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When everything started expanding more rapidly and the number of items of clothing I had to choose from started to deplete further, I borrowed some maternity clothes from my sister-in-law. No doubt, most of us have access to clothes from previously pregnant friends and family members. As long as the clothes were in good condition and would keep me looking good for what was a relatively short period of time (although it may not feel like that at times!), I thought that there was no harm in borrowing them. In fact, it made sense to me to make use of clothes that were just being kept in someone else’s suitcase in the spare room, rather than a) spending a lot of my husband’s hard-earned money and b) having to find a long term storage solution for an alternative wardrobe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As time went on, I started to become bored of wearing the ever-dwindling supply of clothes that still fit, rotating the various tops, tunics or dresses I had with the same two pairs of maternity jeans. I also realised that my husband, although he didn’t say anything, was probably feeling like he was seeing the same clothes all too often. It was at this stage, when around six or seven months pregnant, that I decided to invest in a few good quality items that I knew I could wear long term, both in future pregnancies, and also during the period of weight loss following them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stuck mainly to flattering styles such as the empire style, where the material could flow freely under the bust line and over the stomach and hips. Clothes in this particular style not only made my bump appear smaller, but were also very comfortable. Instead of getting tracksuit bottoms, which was indeed quite tempting towards the end, I opted for leggings, which were not only more tasteful, but could also be mixed and matched with a variety of clothes, and were readily available from most stores in a range of colours. I didn’t limit myself to maternity lines either, which were often over-stocked with huge flowing tops that engulfed me in material. Instead, I also acquired some items from normal ranges, just in larger sizes. In many ways, I found shopping in this manner much easier, since maternity sizes varied hugely from store to store and half the time I ended up returning the items since they had strange proportions. Shops such as New Look, ASOS and H&amp;M often had sales on, so it wasn’t too difficult to find stylish items on offer. Tops with ruched sides and tie backs were handy since they gave me room to expand throughout the second and third trimesters without needing to buy more clothes. Many maxi dresses were also flattering and served me well, especially when heartburn was only increased by tighter fitting clothes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that I also had to remind myself of was to accessorise. Despite the shape of my body changing and no longer being able to wear many of my old clothes, I could still accessorise to my heart’s content and look good doing it! In fact, making a concerted effort to wear jewellery and scarves actually lifted my mood, especially towards the end when I often felt like a big whale. Not giving up on wearing make-up, despite often feeling that my bags were too dark to even bother trying to cover, also aided my self-esteem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The fruits of my efforts really struck home on one occasion, when I successfully managed to fight my urge to remain in my pyjamas all day. Despite being tired and much preferring to take a nap instead, I decided to dress up on my husband’s return from work, having become more motivated after listening to a lecture on marriage and the rewards of pleasing one’s husband. And what better response to boost your mood than your husband commenting “Who said you can’t look good while you’re pregnant?!”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many women are led to believe they need to spend serious amounts of cash on fancy beauty products in order to take care of their skin properly. During a global recession, in particular, these ‘guilty pleasures’ can start to add up. Money and food waste can be prevented by simply preparing homemade skincare products from items you probably already have in the fridge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>Benefits of Homemade Skincare </strong></span><br />
You may be thinking that preparing your own homemade products is more hassle than it’s worth, but take just a minute to look at all the ways you’ll benefit from doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
1. More bang for your buck. Think about how much more product you get when making something yourself, especially when it comes to skincare. You control the amount and know exactly how much organic avocado oil really is in your face cleanser. After all, store-bought products contain such small amounts of those beneficial ingredients we purchased them for in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Knowledge of what you’re putting on your skin. You know what’s good for your skin type. What do you really know about the added ingredients in skincare products? Are they all natural? Organic? Are they safe for your skin as well as the environment? Do they contain hidden irritants not indicated on the label? How long have they been sitting on the store shelf? When you’ve made it yourself, you’ll have answers to all of these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Healthy outcomes for you and the environment. Just like the food we eat, we need to concern ourselves with what we put on our skin, the body’s largest organ. A good rule of thumb is, “if you can’t eat it, don’t put it on your skin”. As a result, the homemade skincare product will give you better results as well as decompose naturally when discarded. No plastic bottles or containers to deal with. Eco-friendly skincare is waiting for you &#8211; in your kitchen!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some recipes for homemade concoctions you can put together using easy-to-find kitchen ingredients. This issue, we start with cleansers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>1. CITY GRIME CLEANSER</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1640" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_128327429-1024x697.jpg" alt="shutterstock_128327429" width="1024" height="697" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_128327429-300x204.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_128327429-768x523.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_128327429-1024x697.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I absolutely love this cleanser. It’s hard to believe that oil can actually make your face feel clean, but this recipe combines honey with olive oil to completely slough-off any build up resulting from pollutants that sticks to the skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>Ingredients:  </strong></span><br />
• 2 tsp. olive oil</p>
<p>• 1 tsp. honey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>Preparation:</strong></span><br />
Mix ingredients together and apply to skin. Gently massage thoroughly, making sure all ingredients are absorbed into the skin. Rinse off with warm water using a gentle cloth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>2. DAIRY FACE WASH</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1642" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_265271723-1024x682.jpg" alt="shutterstock_265271723" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_265271723-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_265271723-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_265271723-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>Ingredients:  </strong></span><br />
• 1 tsp. lime juice<br />
• 1 tbsp. light olive oil<br />
• ½ cup whole milk yogurt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>Preparation:</strong></span><br />
Mix all ingredients and apply to face, rubbing in gently. Leave on 1-2 minutes then rinse with warm water. The yogurt and oil will smooth your skin while the citrus will add a toning effect to the wash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>3. CITRUS CLEANSER</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1643" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_278111384-1024x673.jpg" alt="shutterstock_278111384" width="1024" height="673" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_278111384-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_278111384-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/shutterstock_278111384-1024x673.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>Ingredients:  </strong></span><br />
• Juice of one lemon, seeds removed<br />
• 1 egg white</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #81ab03;"><strong>Preparation:</strong></span><br />
Beat the lemon juice and egg white very well. Apply mixture all over face and leave on for 30 minutes. Rinse with cold water.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Oishee Alam shares her tips on caring for our hardworking hands and feet.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I looked down at my hands and my feet and felt a pang of pity for them. I studied them closely; the bulbous knuckles on skinny fingers, the calloused soles, the fine lines that were starting to settle comfortably into my skin and the jagged fingernails that I tried so hard not to bite, often failing. My hands and feet work hard for me every single day. They enable me to type up my thesis, wash dishes, run for the bus and go hiking on weekends. They put up with the burns I give them when I stubbornly carry a too-hot bowl to the table with my bare hands, and they silently endure painful blisters while I break in a pair of new shoes. And yet it’s my face that I spend the most time and money maintaining and preening, while my hands and my feet go largely unnoticed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Since that realisation, I’ve tried to put as much love and care into my hands and feet as I do my face. Insha Allah, the following tips will help you do the same, whether young or old, male or female, manual labourer or office worker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf225f;"><em><strong>Hands</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color: #bf225f;"> <strong>Keep them clean…</strong></span><br />
…but avoid using scalding hot water or harsh soaps. You want to get rid of the dirt and grime, but not the natural oils that keep our hands moisturised and protect against the wind and cold. Use warm water and a gentle cleanser instead. Make sure to dry them thoroughly after washing by patting them with a soft towel &#8211; if water remains, it will dry out your skin as it evaporates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf225f;"><strong>Moisturise, moisturise, moisturise!</strong></span><br />
Just like your face, your hands need to stay moisturised throughout the day, so keep a hand cream handy in your bag and in your bathroom or bedroom. The lack of a hydrating hand cream is the primary reason for dry and chapped hands. Washing dishes is a major culprit in this regard, because the hot water and chemical detergents that are great for removing grease from your plates are also excellent at stripping your hands of natural oils. If you do not already wear latex or rubber gloves when washing up, try and make a habit of doing so. Many suggest slathering cream on your hands before slipping on the rubber gloves, as the warmth of the water facilitates the moisturising process. On cold days, warm gloves can help keep the circulation in your hands up and prevent dryness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf225f;"><strong>Anti-aging for your hands</strong></span><br />
The skin on the back of your hands is as thin and delicate as it comes, and as a result your hands are also the site of some of the earliest signs of aging. As well as moisturising regularly, you should apply sunscreen to the back of your hands when you apply it to your face – it will only take an extra ten seconds, but can dramatically reduce the aging process. Age spots from pre-existing sun damage can be toned down with anti-pigmentation creams.  You may also want to look into washing the backs of your hands with an alpha-hydroxy cleanser, which encourages cell renewal. Hand creams that contain Retin-A, or other anti-aging creams, help your hands produce more collagen, keeping them looking firmer and fuller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf225f;"><strong>Smooth it out…</strong></span><br />
…by exfoliating regularly, just like you would your face. Make a natural exfoliant by mixing salt and lemon juice and keep it in the shower to exfoliate your hands once or twice a week. Once a month, warm some olive oil or coconut oil and massage it gently into the skin on your hands. Wrap your hands in clingfilm and leave for a few minutes before removing. Your hands should feel much softer and smoother!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf225f;"><em><strong>Feet</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color: #bf225f;"> <strong>Getting wet</strong></span><br />
As Muslims, we are fortunate in that we don’t have to remember to wash our feet regularly – it is already built into our daily routines. Try and use a mild cleanser at least once a day, particularly between your toes. Make sure to dry them completely afterwards. Because we do wash our feet more often than others may, we need to be particularly aware of moisturising them so that they don’t dry out. Rub foot cream on your feet before bed, and then put on a pair of socks – this will give you beautifully soft, moisturised feet in the morning. Avoid applying cream to the area between your toes, as it is a prime area for fungus to grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf225f;"><strong>Balancing act</strong></span><br />
Unless you are bedridden, your feet carry the weight of your entire body all day, every day.  You should exercise your feet once a day to re-energise them, improve circulation and restore balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Loosen your muscles and joints by shaking your feet in the same way you would shake your hands to get rid of a cramp. Wriggle your toes on each feet to relax them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. With your heels on the floor, tap your toes against the floor as though pressing down on a pedal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Place one foot on top of the other, and press the top one down while trying to pull up with the bottom foot. Reverse and repeat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Use your toes to write the letters of the alphabet, first with one foot, then the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Try picking up a pencil or marble from the floor with your toes to make use of muscles you normally don’t think about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Sitting on the floor with your legs straight ahead of you and your back straight, rotate your feet clockwise ten times; take a break, and do the same anti-clockwise. Make sure to keep your knees still so that your ankles are doing all the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Still on the floor, flex your feet forward ten times and back ten times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf225f;"><strong>Pamper them</strong></span><br />
Every so often, pamper your feet – they will especially appreciate this after the above exercises or a long day of walking. Soak your feet for 5-10 minutes in warm or tepid water, or as long as you feel is needed. Infuse the water with a few drops of essential oils or sea salts. Peppermint will cool them down, chamomile will soothe any abrasions or blisters, and lavender is great for relaxing. Tea tree oil has excellent anti-viral, antiseptic and antifungal properties. Dry them properly and put them up for 15 minutes. If you have the time, follow it up with a foot massage. Using a massage oil or essential oils, massage your feet one at a time, making sure to pay attention to your ankles, arches, heels and individual toes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incorporate these tips into your daily routine and show those hands and feet some love!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have been following our series on skin care rules so far, then you know the importance of cleansing, toning, moisturising, day care and night care. This brings us to the last and possibly the most important skin care rule: exfoliation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exfoliation is a procedure that helps the removal of dead cells from skin’s surface, which if allowed to remain can become a cause of various skin issues such as dullness, breakouts, whiteheads, blackheads etc. Regular exfoliation of our facial skin results in a fresh healthy glow, increased capacity of the skin to absorb moisture, reduction in fine lines and wrinkles and diminished scarring from breakouts or acne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Physical exfoliation of the skin can be done by using mildly abrasive products such as a silk mitts, soft micro-fibre washcloths, exfoliation sheets, micro-bead facial scrubs, or exfoliating masks. Salon procedures such as microdermabrasion are also very popular for physical skin exfoliation. Another option is chemical exfoliation. This method removes the dead cells using products containing salicylic acid, glycolic acid, alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), to name a few. These chemicals must be used in the presence of a medical professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Exfoliation is an abrasive procedure so it is only recommended to be done no more than 2-3 times a week. Additionally, exfoliants may cause skin irritation and redness. So, test a sample sized product on the back of your palm before you apply any product directly on your facial skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Skin exfoliation is one of the most important steps in skin care because it truly brings out your most beautiful skin texture, which is further enhanced by other skin care practices such as cleansing, toning, and moisturising. I hope you have found this series beneficial. Stay beautiful!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Here are Lotifa Begum's top tips to save time, stay productive and organise that wardrobe!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you woken up and looked into the wardrobe and thought to yourself &#8216;I have nothing to wear!&#8217; It&#8217;s every Muslimah&#8217;s nightmare and it really affects our productivity!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><strong>My Wardrobe&#8217;s a Mess &#8211; Help!</strong></span><br />
The above is a scenario I know many of you will share, I like to call it the Muslimah&#8217;s wardrobe dilemma! Many sisters spend an hour (or more!) to get ready and out of the house making it a BIG time stealer! I&#8217;ve learnt over the years how to get SMART with my wardrobe so now I can get ready in 30 minutes (including using the bathroom!) and get out of that door!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><strong>Look Good, Feel Productive </strong></span><br />
As a young Muslimah I definitely believe in the saying &#8216;look good, feel good&#8217;! There&#8217;s a naturally improved sense of productivity when we feel positive about our image and especially when others notice it by complimenting! As Muslims we are encouraged to have <em>ihsan</em> (excellence) in our lives which includes dressing well.  Research also shows the positive impact looking good can have on our emotions and esteem, therefore we should strive to &#8216;look good and feel productive’! Islam encourages us to dress well as the Prophet (SAW) always made an effort to be well presented and took care of his appearance. It is also important to look good and clean around any non-Muslims we see since it gives a strong impression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every Muslimah has her own style so this article isn&#8217;t about the style for you but rather it is about using the top 5 wardrobe hacks to get productive and get your wardrobe organised so you don&#8217;t face this dilemma every morning!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><strong>1. Organise Clothes into Compartments  </strong></span><br />
Firstly, to be productive, you have to get that wardrobe organised! Recently, my sisters and I invested in a compartmentalised wardrobe, one with a full length mirror and sliding doors that allows you to hang clothes but also has compartments. I decided that it would be good to organise the wardrobe with my clothes as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><em>Smart Vs Casual </em></span><br />
Clothes like trousers/skirts were hung up in one place, blazers for work, blouses and other tops all in an easily visible place with my silk scarves on a separate section as these are all items I know I can look at quickly and match up for work. This top section was my &#8216;smart&#8217; clothes section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remainder of my items such as scarves for everyday wear and dresses which I wouldn&#8217;t normally wear to work were folded and put into other compartments, this was for the times when perhaps I wasn&#8217;t in a rush and could choose a scarf at leisure &#8211; I know a lot of Muslimahs are hijab junkies just like me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><em>Coordinate Colours </em></span><br />
I found it really helped to organise my clothes so that similar colours and shades were in the same place. That way, I was able to quickly match my outfit with the right hijab shade and this also meant that I could see what colours I have already for any future shopping trips as I like to buy shades that match outfits I already have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><em>Seasonal Wear</em></span><br />
Update your wardrobe and give it a revamp every time the season changes, this means packing away the summer dresses and getting the scarves and knitwear out during winter. This will also create more room in the cupboard and ensure you have the right kind of clothes for that time of year. Some items of clothing which we tend to need every winter are worth investing more money in, I recall buying a good coat whilst at uni which lasted me years and saved me buying a coat every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><em>De-clutter Regularly!</em></span><br />
We all hate to admit it, but us women just buy way too many clothes that we don&#8217;t need and if we looked in the closet we&#8217;d find so many items that are just lying there unused! I regularly have a de-clutter session which allows me to sort through clothes that I no longer wear and bag them up to donate to charity or sell them off. De-cluttering also has a positive impact on you mentally and spiritually since we shouldn&#8217;t be materially attached, just see how much better you feel after a de-clutter session!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: De-cluttering sessions are NOT a licence to go and buy more clothes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><strong>2. Buy Matching Items</strong></span><br />
A rule of thumb for me when I go shopping is to never to buy an item which I may not have a matching hijab for. So be SMART and only buy items of clothing which you already have a matching hijab for. Plain coloured hijabs also seem to be more smart and ideal for matching with other clothing items rather than floral prints unless you wear them with plain clothes. This is also economical as I found I wouldn&#8217;t buy clothes and then spend extra money on a matching hijab! Only for special occasions like weddings or events do I make an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><strong>3. Decide the Night Before!</strong></span><br />
One of the most common reasons sisters run late is probably indecisiveness on what to wear! This means you need to think about the appropriate outfit and decide the night before. Depending on the engagement, I will choose a smart or casual look. For a corporate environment, sisters may need to wear smart as it reflects your organisational culture and also dressing well is part of Islam as it reflects our level of professionalism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided, iron it and get it ready on a hanger. Trust me, this makes your morning much more productive and smooth as you chuck on clothes instead of rummaging through the wardrobe when you&#8217;ve got kids to rush to school or a meeting to run to! I feel such ease knowing I&#8217;ve sorted that out for the next day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><strong>4. Find Bargains!</strong></span><br />
I wouldn&#8217;t consider myself a shopaholic as I really dislike hours on end of shopping but once I get my eye on a good sale, it&#8217;s hard to drag me away! I&#8217;ve often bought great items of clothes half their original price and amazed my colleagues/friends. This has helped me save loads of money and also meant that I don&#8217;t unnecessarily spend money on items I don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often I&#8217;ll invest in an expensive item if I see it would be useful as a long-term investment and then make it a rule that if I&#8217;ve done some bargain shopping one month then I won&#8217;t shop again until next month. Also I&#8217;ve found that online shopping during discount periods saves the physical time wasted in getting to shops and also offers exclusive buys. Finally one of my other wardrobe secrets is that I&#8217;ve bought clothes from charity shops; I&#8217;ve found some great clothes and your money goes towards a good cause! Also ethical clothing and socially conscious fashion is an new trend such as buying Fairtrade clothing which can help people out of poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #07a68e;"><strong>5. Invest in Multi-Purpose Clothes</strong></span><br />
This wardrobe hack is especially useful for mums as it has helped me mix and match items on many occasions. Buy items which include colours you know you often wear so that you can match them up with other clothes you wear often. Long sleeve tops can cover your arms and allows modest dress under sleeveless shirts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of my favourite places to buy modest clothing online include Silk Route, Aab, The Closet and Essence of Hijaab as well as Pearl Daisy for hijabs. Souk bazaars and markets can also be a good place for reduced, off-the-high-street wear and local high street shops like H&amp;M and New Look are some of my favourite places for my professional wardrobe pieces as well as Accessorize, Monsoon and Zara for the slightly more high-end products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the top 5 wardrobe hacks for a Productive Muslimah so I hope you will use them to boost your productivity and quit wasting time.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[As beautiful and classy as the silk garment is, something about it makes it unfriendly to nature. Wardah Abbas teaches us how to m]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I got to own and wear a silk dress was on my tenth birthday. Long before then, my mum used to tell me how beautiful the silk dress was. She called it the ‘queen of fabrics’ and the ‘fabric for queens’. So, on that special day of mine, I actually did feel like a queen. My joy lasted far beyond the colourful celebration because even at madrasah, I was told that silk was the garment for the people of Jannah. And so it was that my love for silk continued to grow beyond bounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My great love for the silk fabric was not to last long, however. I visited my beautiful friend Nabeelah on a cold weekend, wearing a beautiful silk dress under a long cardigan. As soon as I got into her room, I pulled off the pullover and WOW! Her eyes were all over the dress. I smiled secretly, thinking that she really loved what I was wearing. I was wrong. It turned out that my lovely fabric was a taboo in their little haven called home. Her parents were vegans and the silk fabric to them was the fabric of cruelty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt uneasy and sad at the fact that there were two sides to silk’s coin. I wanted to know more. My friend had told me that the fabric was a product of cruelty, but how was I to know? My thirst for knowledge led me to ask my home economics teacher in school why the silk fabric was a product of cruelty. There and then, she quenched my thirst, explaining to me the whole process of its making and telling me how cruel it is to both the silk worms and to humans. According to Aria Melton, the silk fabric comes from the bombyx mori caterpillar or silkworm. This caterpillar does not exist naturally in the wild. Humans have domesticated it for so many centuries that it cannot survive on its own and requires constant human care. Most silk on the market is reeled or made by unwinding the caterpillar’s chrysalis (cocoon). In order to keep a caterpillar from developing into a moth, producers steam, boil or expose the chrysalis to dry heat, killing the caterpillar inside. Some other producers do allow some caterpillars to develop into moths for breeding purposes, but due to the severity of their inbreeding, bombyx mori moths are blind, cannot fly and cannot eat. All they can do is mate and then starve to death. This confirms the extreme cruelty meted out to these wonderful creatures of Allah (SWT) which we are supposed to preserve. Its cruelty to humans stem out of the fact that workers in non–Western silk-making industries are exploited with long hours, dangerous working conditions and extremely low wages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, I became inclined to stop wearing silk as the ugly image of the torture inflicted on the beautiful creatures of Allah (SWT) continued to sicken me. But as time went by and I grew older, it became a dilemma for me, more so because I learnt that silk fabric is one of the most eco-friendly fabrics as it is not made via a chemical-based synthetic process. This was a contrast to what I already knew about the fabric. I continued to think, “What is eco–friendly about a fabric that metes out so much torture to some living creatures of Allah (SWT)? Isn’t eco–living supposed to be about protecting and preserving Allah’s creatures?” And most of all, this fabric of all fabrics has been specifically chosen for the people of Jannah. Yet, deep inside me was a remnant of my past love for silk that made me want to dig deeper to solve my puzzles. There and then, on my road to discovery, I came across two eco–friendly silk fabrics: vegan silk and wild silk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vegan silk (also called peace silk) is made from the worm casings gathered only after the moths have emerged and moved on, thus allowing all the moths to hatch and making the fabric slubby, warmer and softer. In the same vein, wild silk is produced from the empty cocoons of silk worms after the caterpillars have lived an entirely natural life free from interference. These two cruelty-free types of silk are for every silk-loving sister who does not want to compromise her eco–love for any luxury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing that I could start shopping for silk after so many years of avoidance was more liberating than I could ever have imagined. The good news is that my vegan family friends can now cross the silk fabric off their taboo list. So, let me tell you this &#8211; if you choose to buy silk, choose wild silk or vegan silk (it’s always clearly labelled, so accept no substitutes), especially the ones made from either Eri or Tassar moths. If you are not convinced enough, you may care to know the following facts about conventional silk:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The durability myth about conventional silk being the strongest natural fibre is only true when the processing is minimal and the fabric is fairly heavy in weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Conventional silk fibre is covered with a sticky substance called sericin. Manufacturers remove this in an alkaline bath to give the fabric a better drape and prepare it for dyeing. This process is called “degumming” and it removes up to 20% of the silk’s weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Unlike most other fabrics that retailers sell by the yard, raw conventional silk is sold to wholesalers by weight. Therefore, the weight lost through degumming is added back with metallic salts that are easily absorbed by silk. This increases costs, puts undesirable metals against our bodies and makes the finished goods much less durable and more sensitive to perspiration, tears, scratches and pulls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Cultivated conventional silk is often dyed with toxic acid or dye containing heavy metals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, wouldn’t you rather make a better green choice? Considering these facts, you should also try looking for silk that has been dyed naturally and made as close to home as possible. Another option is to buy silk secondhand, so that you do not increase the demand for “new” silk. If you still have your doubts concerning the silk fabric, you may like to consider some plant-derived fibres which offer a similar look and feel to silk. Ingeo, made from corn, and Tencel, made from wood pulp, both resemble silk. Some types of cotton fabric mimic the lustre and weight of silk as well. The bottom line when shopping for environmentally friendly silk is to do your homework or shop at a reputable eco-friendly goods store or online supplier who will weigh the facts for you in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, we all have the right to feel like queens and imitate the people of Jannah of which, inshaAllah, we will all soon become in our eco–friendly silk fabrics.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have all watched make-up tutorials where the make-up ‘guru’ is piling on layers and layers of products such as foundation, concealer, eye shadow etc. But let&#8217;s face it, not all women like an overly made-up look. To avoid looking over-groomed and achieve a naturally flawless-looking face, follow the make-up tips below and always remember, ‘less is more!’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e0a384;"><strong>Prep your skin</strong></span></p>
<p>The natural look starts with healthy-looking skin. This step includes washing your face with a gentle cleanser and lightly exfoliating your skin to get rid of any dead skin cells from the surface of your face. This step makes the blending of make-up easy and look more natural.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e0a384;"><strong>Use a tinted moisturiser</strong></span></p>
<p>For a natural look, foundation is usually too greasy and ends up giving that cakey appearance. A great alternative is a tinted lotion which provides adequate moisture to your skin along with some coverage to even out your skin tone, without looking over-done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e0a384;"><strong>Use a concealer only if needed</strong></span></p>
<p>Not everyone needs to use a concealer. If you have visible blemishes or under-eye circles, then gently dab and apply some concealer on those specific areas. Pick a concealer shade that is half a shade lighter than your natural complexion to give a brightening effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e0a384;"> <strong>Use a cream blush</strong></span></p>
<p>Cream blushes look more natural than powder ones. They blend in easily and give a natural-looking flush of colour to your cheeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e0a384;"><strong> Apply eye shadow</strong></span></p>
<p>Soft, neutral colours such as espresso, light gold and light browns will help shape up your eyes without making them look heavily drenched in make-up. Extend the colour all over your eyelid and stop right at the crease, blending out any harsh edges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e0a384;"><strong>Lightly apply the eye-liner</strong></span></p>
<p>It is very important not to draw harsh, dark lines with the eyeliner. For a natural look, gently define your eyes with a light application of the eyeliner. Also, instead of black, choose a brown eyeliner pencil for a more natural-looking appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e0a384;"><strong>Lightly apply mascara to your lashes</strong></span></p>
<p>Similar to the eyeliner, choose to go with a brown or brownish-black mascara, instead of a black one to enhance your eyelashes without making it look too harsh and spider-like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e0a384;"> <strong>Define your lips</strong></span></p>
<p>It is preferred to choose a lip colour that matches your own lip shade closely. Also, opt for a lip tint that is both glossy and moisturising for a more natural look, rather than a dark, greasy lipstick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following these simple tips will help you achieve that naturally flawless ‘no make-up’ look, without looking over-groomed. Happy grooming!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Why not take a little time for yourself to de-stress and use the power of roses to restore your natural beauty. Sumayyah Meehan re]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rose in all its splendid beauty has been a part of beauty recipes and even medicine for centuries in countries such as ancient Egypt, India and Greece. Rose oil or ‘water’ can be found in almost every beauty product on the market including face creams and masks. The rose is an all-natural astringent that tones the skin. It also helps to prevent wrinkles and lessen the appearance of scarring. It also has a special place in aromatherapy as the scent of the rose helps to alleviate depression and creates a sense of euphoria when the scent is inhaled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s go to the kitchen and whip up some of summer’s best rose beauty recipes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de0265;"><strong>STRESS RELIEVING ROSE PETAL ‘TEA BAG’ BATH</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6466" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170718_125203-01.jpeg" alt="cof" width="591" height="591" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170718_125203-01-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170718_125203-01-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170718_125203-01-400x400.jpeg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170718_125203-01.jpeg 591w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de0265;"><em><strong>Ingredients:</strong></em></span><br />
½ cup rose petals<br />
¼ cup dried mint<br />
¼ cup whole oats (ground)<br />
¼ cup dried milk powder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de0265;"><em><strong>Method:</strong></em></span><br />
In an old nylon stocking or muslin bag, combine all the ingredients and tie the end. Give it a good shake’ and your ‘tea bag’ is done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de0265;"><em><strong>To Use:</strong></em></span><br />
Run a very hot bath and toss in the tea bag. Let it simmer in the tub for about 10 minutes as the water cools slightly. You can add more hot water to warm the bath. The ‘tea bag’ can be reused once. Just be sure to hang it up to dry before your next bath!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de0265;"><strong>HOMEMADE ROSE WATER</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6465" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_311270519.jpg" alt="shutterstock_311270519" width="591" height="591" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_311270519-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_311270519-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_311270519-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_311270519.jpg 591w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></p>

In a small saucepan, bring the water to a rolling boil. Add the rose petals and remove from heat. Leave to steep for a full 30 minutes. Drain and store in the refrigerator in a tightly sealed glass bottle. The rose water will last in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de0265;"><em><strong>To Use:</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color: #de0265;"><em>Astringent &#8211;</em></span> Rose water is excellent as an astringent to cleanse the skin of dirt, oil and impurities. Soak a cotton ball in the rose water and wipe over the skin to purify and tone.</p>
<p><span style="color: #de0265;"><em>Tired/Swollen Eyes –</em></span> Rose water is an all-natural way to cool and soothe tired eyes. Use an eyecup to rinse the eyes with the rose water. Alternatively, soak cotton balls with the rose water and place on tired eyes for at least 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Trained beauty therapist Humma Sharif talks us through the head to toe beauty regime of a bride-to-be.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now, it’s no myth that every bride wants to look absolutely fantabulous on the most special day of her life and thereafter and why shouldn’t she? The key to looking amazing on your wedding day is to know that you look amazing – and making adequate preparations! Here’s my fool-proof guide to a gorgeous look on your special day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 54">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #d67eaa;"><strong>Radiant Skin</strong></span></p>
<p>For every bride, achieving glowing skin should be at the top of her list and should start at least a few months prior to her big day. Whatever your daily routine or schedule, looking after yourself should be a priority. In order to implement a skin care regime that is suited to you, use the list below to identify your skin type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Normal:</em> This skin type boasts an even, healthy colour over the face and neck, a smooth texture without blemishes. Facial lines are relevant to age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><em>Dry:</em> This skin type looks dull, flaky and can feel dry. Cheeks are prone to redness. Pores are small with little sebum being produced. Dry skin is more prone to premature aging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Greasy/Oily:</em> Although the surface of the skin can be shiny from sebum, the colour appears dull. Pore size is larger particularly on forehead, nose and chin. This skin type is less likely to wrinkle but more likely to develop spots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Combination:</em> Combination of any skin type, mainly dry cheeks and oily ‘T-zone’ panel (forehead, nose, chin).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sensitive:</em> Skin can be red and sore. Can develop patches of dryness and irritation especially after using products containing fragrance and chemicals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mature:</em> Sebum production reduces with age thus drying out the skin. Skin may look and feel delicate and may be wrinkled due to lack of collagen and elastin. Dark patches or ‘age spot’ may develop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have identified your skin type, you can purchase products that suit your skin. However, if you are unable to conclude what your skin type is, it may be worth going to a Beauty Therapist who will be able to help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least every night as part of your bedtime routine, incorporate a mini facial which you can do yourself. Here’s how:</p>
<p>1. Use a milk based cleanser to massage onto your skin using firm pressure. This will open the pores and remove any impurities and dead skin. Wipe off the product with a cotton pad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Use a mild toner to close the pores and to remove any excess cleanser left on the skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Moisturise using an upward stoking motion. Avoid using moisturiser around the delicate eye area and instead opt for an eye gel (preferable containing Vitamin E especially if you suffer from puffy eyes). Massage the cool gel around the eyes using the tips of the fingers from the inner corners of the eye to the temple, this movement will drain away any fluid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 54">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>4. Include exfoliation into your routine once or twice a week. <strong><a href="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/2016/02/07/the-kitchen-beautician-exfoliation/" target="_blank">Try these recipes to exfoliate your skin and get rid of dead skin cells.</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend that you go for a full facial at a spa or salon once a fortnight in the run-up to your wedding. Drink approximately 6-8 glasses of per day and don’t forget the recommended 5 portions of fruit per day; it really will have an effect not just on your exterior but internally too. And don’t forget the exercise! You don’t need to join a gym, just simple exercise movements like 25 sit ups a day, jogging for 15mins etc will help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p><strong>Tip: </strong><em>Try to walk or cycle as opposed to drive.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #d67eaa;"><strong>Flawless make-up</strong></span></p>
<p>Every bride’s dream is to look no less than stunning on her big day. But how to wear enough make-up for a flawless finish without it looking ‘caked on’! The ‘caked on’ effect can be a result of rough, uneven skin or a bad make-up artist. Insha allah, by following a consistent facial skin care regime, your skin will be a perfect base for a flawless look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>A good make-up artist will use make-up to highlight and emphasise your best features and to disguise any flaws you may have i.e. dark circles under the eyes. In this way, you end up looking both stunning and natural.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>Many people make the mistake of asking a friend or a family member to be their make up artist for the day and whilst this may be good for the budget, it isn’t the best option. An artist with experience will chose the right colours for you with precision to match your outfit and jewellery. So if you want to bedazzle your husband, girlfriends and family on the day, invest in an experienced make-up artist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>Most, if not all artists will offer a make up trial beforehand; if yours doesn’t then ask her to. Show her your wedding attire. I would advise any bride to wear the top part of her outfit so that your make up artist can get a better idea of the style of make up to do and which colours to use. Remember, don’t be afraid to say no or say what you like. If you’re not fully satisfied, keep looking until you find someone you feel comfortable with and who understands what you want.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d67eaa;"><strong>Luscious Hair</strong></span></p>
<p>Ask your mum or a friend to vigorously massage oil into your hair (I recommend Dabur Amla hair oil – yes, it has a strong scent but the effects are almost immediate), leave over night and then wash off in the morning. This way, not only do you get a step towards healthy hair, you get a nice relaxing head massage too! <strong><a href="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/2016/03/15/lush-locks/" target="_blank">Try these natural remedies for lush locks.</a></strong></p>

<p>If you suffer from dandruff, massage malt vinegar into your hair thoroughly and leave for 15 minutes and then wash off with a mild shampoo. This process can be repeated until the dandruff has disappeared completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a deep conditioning treatment, mix a few spoons of honey and olive oil and apply to the hair. Massage thoroughly from root to tip. Cover your hair with a towel or cling film and leave for 20 minutes. Then wash out and style as desired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to remember that whenever you shampoo your hair, you should use a conditioner straight after. Try to avoid 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner if you want those luscious locks. Another tip would be to try to avoid heat on the hair through the use of hair straighteners and blow-dryers in the run up to the wedding. Let your hair dry naturally; this way your hair will soak up natural moisture instead of having it taken away. If you do desperately need to use a hair straightener/ dryer, then ensure that you use heat protecting products. <a href="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/2016/04/04/getting-it-straight/" target="_blank"><strong>Read these hair straightening tips, to get the best results with your straighteners.</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d67eaa;"><strong>Silky hair-free skin</strong></span></p>
<p>Before you start removing hair, you need to prepare the area for an effective treatment. Start by exfoliating the area, I recommend Avon Smooth Surface Pomegranate Body Polish, £6 for 200ml. Ditch the razor! Shaving removes hairs only from the surface of the skin, making hair grow back faster and thicker. Waxing, on the other hand, pulls the hair from the root, making hair grow back slower and finer. I’d recommend that you get your hair removal done professionally at least once a month simply because it can get tricky to reach those hard-to-see areas such as the back of the legs and underarms. Also, because you are in control of the wax strip, you may not pull the strip off fast enough to effectively remove the hair. The secret to soft, smooth and healthy skin is maintaining moisture so after exfoliating, moisturise! <a href="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/silky-smooth-a-hair-removal-how-to/" target="_blank"><strong>Read more about the various hair removal options here.</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for all you brides to be out there, if you want to look your absolute best on your wedding day and thereafter in your new life too, don’t delay, start your beauty regimen today!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Love the creativity and fun that comes with dressing up – but hate all the waste and environmental and social damage that comes with fast, cheap fashion? You’re not the only one. We love to use fashion to express ourselves creatively and dress modestly in beautiful ways – but hate that sinking feeling that comes when we’ve just had yet another fast-fash splurge. So what can you do? Get eco-friendly of course, with some fabulously inspiring ideas! Read on for six brilliant tips to dress fashionably, whilst helping to protect the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7d6d6d;"><strong>Short sleeves? No problem</strong></span></p>
<p>One of the biggest problems for new hijabis is what to do with all those cute short sleeved tops! After all, while they’re super fun to wear – they’re also not very modest. So does that mean you have to ditch the lot of them? Nope. Instead think of them as the perfect layer for your new favourite hijabi outfit. Short sleeved t-shirts and dresses make the ideal statement piece to be complemented by a <a href="http://www.babble.com/style/10-dos-and-donts-of-wearing-cardigans/" target="_blank">flowing cardigan</a>, waterfall jacket, or cropped blazer.Add a matching scarf on top, and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7d6d6d;"><strong>Turn the old season into a new one</strong></span></p>
<p>Got a lot of fab summer dresses from your pre-hijab days hiding in the back of your wardrobe? Before you pile them all into the charity shop bag, take a closer look. They might just be the start to a gorgeous new outfit. Instead of wearing them as short dresses, just think of them as a tunic top to wear over floaty wide legged trousers, or even a long, flowing skirt. And because your summer clothes will often be much lighter, they are also ideal for layering with – without all the bulk. Why not add a chic turtleneck jumper underneath a spaghetti strap dress and slimline cigarette trousers, for an effortlessly polished look?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7d6d6d;"><strong>Think long</strong></span></p>
<p>You can never go wrong with long, floor length maxi dresses and skirts. But if it feels like you are always having to buy a new wardrobe each season, it’s time to get creative. Get extra life out of your favourite maxi dresses by layering them up – add a cute geeky sweater on top and a denim jacket on top of a flowing gown to create a more dressed-down look for day, or work a more casual jersey dress with a smart blazer and funky hijab for a bright evening outfit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7d6d6d;"><strong>Get thrifty</strong></span></p>
<p>Have a hole in your wardrobe that your creativity just can’t fix? Before you hit the high street for your fashion fix, why not think outside the box and head online or down the local charity shops instead? You’ll not only be giving new life to clothing by recycling old pieces – you might also come across some amazing gems too! Keep an eye out for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rebecca-emily-darling/five-reasons-vintage-clothes_b_6432122.html" target="_blank">vintage items</a> such as 70s maxi dresses, cute 60s accessories or grungy 90s sweaters – they’re the perfect addition to liven up your day to day outfits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7d6d6d;"><strong>Just add accessories</strong></span></p>
<p>If in doubt, just add accessories. If you’ve got a busy week ahead with college or work, then the last thing you need is to stress over coming up with a chic new outfit every day. And your accessories can come to the rescue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #7d6d6d;"><strong>Work with a simple base layer</strong></span></p>
<p>A smart pair of black trousers with a tunic top,or a plain maxi dress can be transformed in lots of ways. Then get as creative as you like with your accessories – bold jangling bracelets and a gilet give a touch of bohemian flair, while a striking necklace and <a href="http://en.modanisa.com/hijab-fashion.htm" target="_blank">bright hijab</a> can add a fresh modern look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to have fun with your wardrobe – and you’ll be surprised at how creative you can be without buying a single new piece!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Oishee Alam chats to Zahrah Habibullah about the art of photography.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #666699;"><em><strong>OA: Tell me a little about what Lah’za Photography is all about. How did it begin, and how has it developed over time?</strong></em></span><br />
ZH: Lah’za Photography was born from a ‘brush of fate’ meeting. Ahmad and I first crossed paths at my inaugural solo art exhibition in Fitzroy, Melbourne in April 2011. Ahmad was asked to come and photograph my event by a friend of his. I saw him with his film camera and was quite taken – by the camera of course!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2536" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1909-1024x683.jpg" alt="IMG_1909" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1909-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1909-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1909-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next six months, the idea for Lah’za was thrown around as we discussed photography and got to know each other. A fateful portrait shoot that I asked Ahmad to do for me sealed the deal. We married in Dec 2011 and Lah’za – which means ‘moment’ in Arabic and incorporates both our names &#8211; was born. We have had a whirlwind year, with both of us (along with my 5 year old son) running the business, juggling work and study, and adjusting to a new life in Melbourne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2524" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/img207.jpg" alt="img207" width="600" height="587" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/img207-300x294.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/img207.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Our first year incorporated some milestone jobs and overseas trips. We travelled to Taupo, New Zealand to photograph the Seekers Retreat 2012, a very spiritual experience. We travelled to Gaza, Palestine to wrap up a documentary essay that Ahmad had been shooting of a little girl named Malak who was born without ears. To end the year, we shot a location wedding in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2525" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Marwa-10-683x1024.jpg" alt="Marwa-10" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Marwa-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Marwa-10-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Marwa-10-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong><em>OA: How would you describe your photography?</em></strong></span><br />
ZH: Our photography is photo-journalistic, modern and candid. We try and capture the moments of a shoot in the most unobtrusive manner.  Ahmad and I both have our own styles of shooting but operate with the same final aesthetic. Ahmad focuses on symmetry and light, and I focus on details and texture. We both love to capture moments that are important and precious in the most unique and creative of ways. We treat every shoot as a design challenge and utilise what we have on hand to tell the clients’ story through the lens, whether it’s a wedding, portrait shoot or at an event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2523" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1936-683x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_1936" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1936-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1936-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_1936-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong><em>OA: What inspired you to become a photographer, and what continues to motivate you?</em></strong></span><br />
ZH: I have always felt like a photographer – from a very young age I could remember strong visual images. When I looked at something I could almost take a picture of it and store it away, and that’s how I would remember places, colours and objects. So when I discovered photography, I was immediately drawn to it. Primarily my focus was not technical but more about capturing emotion, colour and texture. Ahmad has a different approach to photography – his wealth of technical knowledge about cameras and photography made me appreciate it in such a different light. It made, and continues to make, me a better photographer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2533" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/p9-1.jpg" alt="p9" width="792" height="568" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/p9-1-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/p9-1-768x551.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/p9-1.jpg 792w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My photography and artwork in general embodies a sense of celebration of this world. I love beauty and craftsmanship, and my work overlaps a number of disciplines: graphic design, photography, painting, mixed media and jewellery. I enjoy exploring all of these separately and together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also one of our goals to educate people on the importance of the arts and its potential as a vehicle for good, especially in the Muslim community. We want to empower and enlighten and bring about better communication between people, and we feel that photography is a medium through which many people can find a voice. As the famous saying illustrates, “a picture is worth a thousand words”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2532" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wedding-ad-2-1-of-1-1024x681.jpg" alt="wedding ad 2 (1 of 1)" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wedding-ad-2-1-of-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wedding-ad-2-1-of-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wedding-ad-2-1-of-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong><em>OA: What was the most challenging part of starting out as a photographer?</em></strong></span><br />
ZH: I’d have to say the most challenging part is breaking into the world of photography and being taken seriously. Just about every person in the world has access to photography in some way, shape or form, so making people understand what goes into the ‘art’ of making a photograph can be quite difficult. That it encompasses much more than just clicking a shutter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another challenge is fulfilling your own creative vision whilst also managing the client&#8217;s needs at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong><em>OA: What are the main mediums through which you&#8217;ve sought to develop and market your brand?</em></strong></span><br />
ZH: It has helped a great deal that my background is in Graphic Design, so from the beginning Ahmad and I had a clear idea as to what we wanted for the branding. It is still a work in progress and it will evolve as we do, but we feel that the ethos behind why we do what we do is key. Currently, we are marketing through word of mouth and online, and want to build a solid reputation. Our website is the main portal where you can view our work, but Facebook has been a great marketing tool also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong><em>OA: Your portfolio features many beautiful weddings, mashaAllah! What appeals to you about wedding photography? Is it your favourite type of photography?</em></strong></span><br />
ZH: Weddings are AWESOME! Weddings are beautiful and so pretty. There is so much emotion and laughter and love. What we cherish about weddings is knowing that the moments that we capture are ones that will be treasured for generations to come. It really makes us become part of the fabric of the couple’s history and it gives us warm and fuzzy feelings. It is also beautiful to know that our albums will be looked upon by children and grandchildren and great grandchildren for years to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong><em>OA: No doubt you and your husband and partner Ahmad bring different points of view to your photography. What are the benefits and drawbacks (if any) of incorporating multiple viewpoints into your work?</em></strong></span><br />
ZH: The beauty of the way that Ahmad and I work is that we compliment each other’s point of view and shooting style. We focus on different elements in a photo. In most shoots, Ahmad and I will shoot over one another and try different scenarios in unison. Ahmad composes the overall shots with lighting and geometry, and my shots are about the details. We love working together on shoots – if we end up working alone on a job, it feels quite different. Ahmad was recently nominated for the National Portrait Prize in Canberra; in his portrait of a Gazan orphan, he composed the shot and I lit the surroundings.</p>

Remove the peel and pit from the avocado. In a bowl, mash up very well. Apply all over face and neck and leave on for 10-15 minutes. Rinse with warm water. Your skin should feel very soft after this quick and natural application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> for dry skin, add a bit of olive oil to the mashed avocado.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Ingredients:  </strong></span><br />
• ½ banana, mashed<br />
• 1 tbs thick, dark honey<br />
• 1 egg yolk<br />
• ½ cup oatmeal, cooked in milk and cooled</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Quick tips    </strong></em></span><br />
• Add fresh flowers to your favorite moisturisers for their natural fresh scent.</p>
<p>• Save the pits of fruits like avocados and apricots. They can be dried then ground up and added to your favorite creams and used as an exfoliating scrub.</p>
<p>• Keep small containers of your favorite oils with your beauty supplies. Not only will you be more likely to use them, it will, insha Allah, also help you to remember to use those instead of the pricey store-bought products.</p>
<p>• If you make any of these or other homemade skincare products and benefit from them, remember to make more as gifts for the other women in your life.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Anah Maria Active, founded by Anna Peters, is a fashionable modest sportswear line for Muslim women.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anah Maria Active helps Muslim women to remain fashionably modest whilst caring for their bodies, through sports and fitness activities. Their mission is to help Muslim women find appropriate clothing in order to continue to look after their bodies. The Anah Maria Active collection accommodates the fundamental concept of a Muslim woman’s faith in remaining modest throughout her day-to-day activities, without forsaking her modesty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finding appropriate sports and active wear, in a world where figure-hugging design is rather prominent, can be problematic. It’s a difficulty faced by all women who wish to exercise without having to expose themselves. Nonetheless, not only can the collection be worn for religious convictions, but also personal comfort &#8211; a huge number of women from all walks of life prefer not to wear revealing clothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6416" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anna-o-288-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Anna-o-288 (1)" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anna-o-288-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anna-o-288-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anna-o-288-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anna-o-288-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anna-o-288-1-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anna-o-288-1.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Muslim, taking care of our spiritual, emotional and physical well-being is crucial.  Essentially, our bodies are an <em>amanah</em> (trust) from Allah, and therefore it is emphasised that looking after such an <em>amanah</em> is vital &#8211; as a true believer acknowledges the wonder of the human body and is grateful to the Creator. This gratitude is shown by our actions, such as the care and attention given to maintaining optimum health. Anah Maria Active encourages all Muslims to be mindful of this, as having a healthy body allows us to be productive in all aspects of life and thus is to our own benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of keeping fit and healthy is a known fact amongst us all, whether Muslim or not. Frequently exercising aids our bodies to maintain a healthy body mass index and can also reduces many known health risks. Exercise increases muscle tone, improves flexibility, improves endurance, strengthens the heart and fights depression. Additionally it helps achieve significant weight loss, combats heart disease and high blood pressure, as well as reduces the risk of diabetes.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[SISTERS' Reyhana Ismail goes for a fact-finding facial at Lush.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I was given some Lush products as a gift from a colleague almost ten years ago, I’ve been a huge fan. Fresh, organic and handmade, not only do their skincare and haircare products smell gorgeous, they are naturally good for you too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pick up a ‘normal’ bottle of shampoo, and you’ll be faced with a list of chemical-sounding ingredients. Does the average consumer even know what methylisothiazolinone or dimethicone copolymer are? These are actual ingredients in a well-known ‘salon’ brand of shampoo. Compare this to the ingredients list on a Lush shampoo and you’ll find items such as Orange Flower, Coconut Oil and Coarse Sea Salt &#8211; and yes, you can actually see and feel the sea salt and even taste it if a little goes into your mouth. I’d say ninety-five percent of the ingredients on the Lush shampoo are well-known natural ingredients; the other five percent are easy enough to identify. Most people think it doesn’t really matter what goes into our skin or hair products, they just wash out anyway. But what we use on our skin and in our hair is generally absorbed into the bloodstream. A personal trainer once told me that parabens, found in so many everyday products, are chemical compounds possessing oestrogenic properties, which are linked to breast cancer and even weight gain. It&#8217;s enough to make you think twice about what you use!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when Lush advertised a free facial campaign, it wasn’t long before I got my coupon and got myself booked in. A face-mask workshop &#8211; making your own fresh face-mask &#8211; plus a facial tailored to your skin type, sounded like a much-needed afternoon of relaxation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6280" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0031.jpg" alt="DSC_0031" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0031-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0031-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0031.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing I always notice about Lush stores is that you can smell them before you even see them. As I rounded the corner, running a tad late as always, the smell hit me &#8211; their own unique fragrance, the one found in most of their products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was greeted by their always-cheerful staff, and offered a cup of tea whilst I made myself comfortable and had a look around.  The lovely Kirsty, full of immense knowledge and wonderful facts, was to do my one-to-one workshop and facial. We began with the face-mask workshop, making their blueberry mask, Catastrophe Cosmetic, described as ‘a refreshing mix of cleansing blueberries and deep cleansing clay and soothing calamine. Irish moss mucilage, made from Irish moss seaweed and glycerine, carries all the benefits of the blueberry juice into the skin and helps reduce moisture loss.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6274" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0013.jpg" alt="DSC_0013" width="850" height="614" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0013-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0013-768x555.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0013.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We began by crushing the blueberries, by hand, into a big glass bowl. Blueberries are detoxifying and give the skin a healthy boost. I then mixed some almond oil into the bowl. Almond oil is really softening and adds moisture as well as smoothing the surface of the skin. Next, I added glycerine, which is very gentle and cleansing, and then an infusion of steeped seaweed, which is used in many of the products at Lush because of its highly moisturising properties, as well as being full of protein. The final liquid ingredient was Lush’s secret blend of fragrances and essential oils – this is what you can smell outside the store!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6277" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0032.jpg" alt="DSC_0032" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0032-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0032-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0032.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To bind it all together, I mixed in some talc and calamine powder.  These two ingredients are soothing and ideal for sensitive skin, drawing out impurities and reducing imperfections. Once mixed to the right consistency, we put it into pots and left them on ice.  Because the ingredients are so fresh and preservative-free, all face-masks at Lush are best kept refrigerated and last up to three weeks, whilst the ingredients are still fresh and active.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second part of the workshop was the facial. After a discussion about my skin type, we looked at appropriate products from the range that would suit me best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kirsty began by applying a cleanser, ‘Ultrabland,’ made with beeswax and honey. A thick, buttery cream, it is deeply moisturising and great at deep-cleaning the skin, getting rid of make-up and dirt. I had always thought cleansers were to be applied on a cotton pad, quickly wiped over the face, taking no longer than a couple of minutes. However, in this case, I was treated to a lovely deep massage with the thick cleanser. This was then washed off my face with the toner, ‘Breath of Fresh Air.’ Not only does this tone and tighten the skin, but with lavender being the key ingredient here, it also opens the pores and reduces redness. Cool and refreshing, my skin felt beautifully soft already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6267" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0042.jpg" alt="DSC_0042" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0042-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0042-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0042.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She then used the ‘Moon and Sun’ toner tab, which fizzes in hot water and is then used as a steamer. This water can later be kept in the fridge and used as a toner. The main ingredients here were lavender and neroli, which are both very uplifting and believed to enhance your mood and make you happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kirsty then used a luxurious skin serum bar, ‘Full of Grace,’ which is a solid bar that melts with the heat of your hands, and is packed with moisturising ingredients. It is fantastic as a night-cream, because although it is thick, it is also very gentle and soaks into your skin overnight, leaving it fresh and dewy in the morning. Made with ancient forest butters such as Muru Muru butter, it also contains Portobello mushrooms, rose and chamomile blue oil, which all help to restore and repair skin, returning it to its original state. The rose oil in particular has so many beneficial properties – it is replenishing, and ideal for skin conditions such as rosacea and acne-prone skin. For this facial, Kirsty only used a thin layer of the serum bar, but did advise that it can be used a lot thicker, if used on its own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, she applied the face-mask, ‘Brazened Honey’. On their website, it is described as a mask for when you have overdone things, broken the rules of 5-a-day, 8-hours sleep a night, etc. and need to get your tired and dull skin back to being radiant and glowing.  Some of the many ingredients here (a combination of ayurvedic, detoxing ingredients and other favourites) include ground almond shells for smoothing and exfoliating, ginger and lime for revitalising and stimulating, and honey for its antibacterial properties.  This was massaged into the skin and left on for between five and ten minutes. Because it had been kept on ice, it gave a lovely, cool sensation on my warm skin when applied. Kirsty then rinsed this off with the steamer water and a spritz of toner water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I was treated to some ‘Gorgeous’ moisturiser. Made especially for Princess Diana, the recipe was left to Lush when she died. Ingredients include orange blossom, honey, olive oil, evening primrose oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, fresh lemon juice, orange juice, grapeseed oil, pineapple juice, and orange flower absolute, to name but a few. It helps with the skin’s elasticity, heals scars, brightens, tightens and moisturises, and the result is beautifully smelling, dewy, fresh looking skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I would call the ultimate facial. Not just a quick face-mask applied and washed off, it was deep cleansing, revitalising and wonderfully relaxing. And thanks to Kirsty’s knowledge and expertise, I also came away with masses of information about what goes into Lush’s skincare products and how beneficial these ingredients are.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Make a face mask created by Lush product inventor, Helen Ambrosen</strong></span></p>
<p>This beautiful, caring facemask is suitable for all skin types. All of these ingredients have been chosen for their gentle effectiveness and beneficial properties. Grapes cleanse without stripping away natural oils; figs have an enzymic action, encouraging the elimination of dead surface skin cells; softening rose petals soothe; and moisturising honey is extremely good for spots and reducing redness. The addition of fine oatmeal is excellent for very dry, sore skin conditions and will gently cleanse and mop up any excess sebum and dirt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Ingredients   </strong></span><br />
• 12 fresh seedless grapes<br />
• A fresh fig<br />
• A handful of petals from a small rose<br />
• 2 tbsp of honey (ideally a local bee-keepers honey, the fresher the better!)<br />
• 2 tbsp fine oatmeal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Start by liquidising the grapes, figs and rose petals.<br />
2. Stir in the honey.<br />
3. Stir in enough oatmeal to thicken to a soft paste.<br />
4. Leave in the fridge for a short time to chill.<br />
5. Apply to the face and neck.<br />
6. Relax for 5 – 10 minutes whilst the mask dries.<br />
7. Splash your face with water and gently exfoliate the skin using circular motions. Then wash the mask away.</p>

		<description><![CDATA['Stylist for the Muslimaat,’ Natasha Somalia shares her pro-tips for keeping your hair beautifully styled when you ‘whip off]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone wants to be able to keep their hair looking astonishing and gorgeous under the hijab for those special occasions when they plan to take it off or even just for when they get home! The question of “How?” is one that I receive in my salon on a daily basis. Here are some of my secret tips and techniques, using a variety of methods for several style options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having fabulous hair under the hijab is difficult for people with wavy or curly hair, but maintaining straightened hair throughout the day becomes all the more difficult. Sisters use all kinds of spritz, gels and hairspray to keep their hair straight, and hold their desired look. Apart from that, there are other tricks to keeping your hair maintained under the hijab for a longer period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Straightening your hair</strong></span><br />
For the straight look, take a pea-sized drop of ‘anti-humidity’ or ‘anti-frizz’ serum and run it through your hair, from the roots to the ends. Your cuticles will now be sealed and the serum will add shine to your hair. This will also help keep your hair straight for two to four days even, after your gathering. When straightening your hair, use a good quality hair straightener; older and cheaper straighteners may not be able to make your style last for a long period of time. Also, for occasions when you want straight hair, it’s good to keep shampoos and conditioners on hand that are specifically meant for achieving straight hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Read More: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/2016/04/04/getting-it-straight/" target="_blank">Getting it Straight</a></em></span></strong></p>
<p><em>Perfect for giving hair a polished look, hair straighteners are ideal for removing unwanted curls and frizz. Here are some tips on how to get started…</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you plan on wearing your hair up, don’t shampoo it on the day of the event, it’s easier to style if it has been shampooed at least 24hrs before.  If your hair is long, you should curl it first and use just about a pea-sized amount of styling potion, which will give your style some ‘umpf.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Medium length hair</strong></span><br />
If your hair is thin use a volumising spray, but only spray it at the roots of your hair. That way, you can reduce the frizz. Then use a good teasing brush for the ‘backcombing technique’ (teasing) to get a perfect hold. Thin hair only needs lightweight products or else the hair will flatten out under the weight. Layered medium-length hair creates texture when doing an evening style, but make sure you have no split ends as they are very difficult to work with – they create too many lengths to control. Split ends need to be trimmed every 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Fancy styles</strong></span><br />
Another great look which is fashionable for all hair types, is three buns rolling down the back of your hair like a ‘Mohawk.’ Side ponytails are great for evening use – tied high or worn low and adorned with great hair accessories. You can also use your own hair as a headband, securing it with mini-clips. This is especially great if you want to do a sleek braid style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Up-Doing</strong></span><br />
The ‘Imperfect’ or ‘Casual’ updo is the easiest look to create. Use hair spray all over, just skipping your fringe – you want this to be soft and manageable so you don’t look like a helmet-head! When securing your buns or updo, secure it with hair slides. The trick is to slide them in a crisscross pattern, giving it a tighter curl. For extra control of ‘fly-aways’ under the hijab, use hair strips (available at beauty suppliers) to loosely tie your style down and prevent your hijab from being puffy. Always keep extra hair slides handy for unwanted loose hair strands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little effort in pre-planning, such as keeping your hair regularly trimmed and knowing which products work well for you, will go a long way in making that special night easier. Insha Allah these tricks and techniques will help you love the way your hair looks and feels.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[There’s more to hair removal than shaving and waxing. Qualified beauty therapist Faiza explains the many options open 
to women]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #e3077c;"><strong>Different methods of hair removal</strong> </span><br />
There are various methods of hair removal &#8211; permanent, semi-permanent and temporary. It should be noted that ‘permanent’ hair removal involves several or more treatments on a regular basis in order to see required results. There are four main methods of removing hair:</p>
<p><span style="color: #e3077c;"><strong><em>1. Epilation</em></strong></span> &#8211; This involves removal of the entire hair follicle from root to shaft away from the surface of the skin. These methods are temporary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e3077c;"><strong><em>2. Depilation</em> </strong></span>&#8211; This involves removing the part of the hair above the skin’s surface. These methods are temporary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e3077c;"><strong><em>3. Electrolysis</em></strong></span> &#8211; This destroys the hairs’ roots with an electric current. This is a permanent method of getting rid of unwanted hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e3077c;"><strong><em>4. Laser hair removal</em></strong></span> &#8211; Laser therapy is the most recent development in hair removal. It is seen as the most effective approach to long-term hair removal. It retards the re-growth of hair and leads to permanent removal of hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Now we will look at the more popular and effective ways at removing hair in terms of their pros, cons and prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e3077c;"><strong>Waxing</strong></span> £9-£40<br />
<em>Advantages:</em><br />
• Removal for over three to four weeks;<br />
• Fast treatment;<br />
• Can be done anywhere on the face or body;<br />
• Removes dead surface skin cells at the same time;<br />
• Wax is heated to a comfortable temperature;<br />
• Eventually reduces the amount of hair regrowth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Disadvantages:</em><br />
• In some cases hair grows back after 2 weeks;<br />
• Can be uncomfortable, especially if skin is not stretched enough<br />
during the procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e3077c;"><strong>Hot Wax</strong></span> £12-£55<br />
<em>Advantages:</em><br />
• Has thicker consistency and is therefore less painful;<br />
• Does not involve the use of strips;<br />
• Very good for getting rid of thicker hairs;<br />
• In smaller areas it is less painful than warm wax;<br />
• Reduces the amount of hair regrowth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Disadvantages: </em><br />
• Hotter temperature;<br />
• Can only be used on smaller areas of hair growth;<br />
• Procedure takes longer to complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e3077c;"><strong>Electrolysis</strong></span> £9-£36<br />
There are two types of electrolysis:<br />
1.  The blend. This involves the client holding a bar which transmits an electrochemical current that enables effective removal of the hair follicle from the base of the root.<br />
2.  Diathermy. This involves a direct current being applied into the base of the hair follicle using a disposable needle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The blend treatment is better for black skin and darker Asian skin with curly hair. Electrolysis and diathermy are good for Caucasian and Asian skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Advantages: </em><br />
• Visible results after first treatment;<br />
• Hair is absent for longer periods of time thus being more permanent;<br />
• If a client has a hormonal imbalance then treatment should cease until a doctor’s note is provided to support the continuation of<br />
treatment;<br />
• Any area of the face may be treated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Disadvantages: </em><br />
• Client will be required to return for consecutive treatments every two weeks;<br />
• Treats small areas only, larger areas may be very time consuming;<br />
• Can be quite painful on the facial area;<br />
• Clients cannot pluck or wax in between treatments; only trimming is permissible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e3077c;"><strong>Laser hair removal </strong></span><br />
There are three types of lasers that I’ve had experience with which I’m able to recommend:<br />
<span style="color: #e3077c;"><em>1.  Soft light laser</em></span> £50-£250 &#8211; Nd-YAG laser. The skin is waxed prior to treatment and a thin carbon layer is applied to the surface of the skin to enable the laser to penetrate into the hair follicles.</p>
<p><em>Advantages: </em><br />
• Waxing and plucking is permissible in between treatments;<br />
• Very good results after 4+ treatments;<br />
• Both small and large areas may be treated i.e. face and body;<br />
• Between 6 to 12 treatments are required for visible longstanding results depending on the area being treated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Disadvantages:</em><br />
• Clients cannot go under hot, direct sunlight or sunbathe for up to 48 hours;<br />
• The treatment can be very messy due to the application of carbon prior to application of laser;<br />
• Can be very uncomfortable in sensitive areas;<br />
• Cannot be used near the eye area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e3077c;"><em>2. Light-Heat-Energy</em></span> £40-£220 &#8211; (also known as LHE or Spa touch) Prior to treatment the hair is trimmed to 3 millimetres. Then a flash of simultaneous heat and light is applied directly onto the skin. The heat targets and destroys the root of the hair follicles immediately.</p>
<p><em>Advantages:</em><br />
• Treats 1-2 inches at a time;<br />
• Clean and easy;<br />
• No messy gels or creams are required during the treatment;<br />
• Very mild erythema (redness of skin) in comparison to some of the other lasers;<br />
• Re-growth is much sparser and is often noted after each treatment.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Disadvantages: </em><br />
• Client cannot wax or pluck hairs in between treatments;<br />
• Requires a 2-4 week wait before client can return for the next treatment;<br />
• No sun beds, tanning, or contact with hot direct sunlight for up to 6 weeks prior to or after any treatment;<br />
• Cannot be used on clients using the medication RetinA or RoAccutane;<br />
• If you are an insulin-dependent diabetic, you cannot be treated;<br />
• Cannot be used on very dark skin.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #e3077c;"><em>3. Intense Pulse light (also known as IPL)</em></span> £40-£230 &#8211; The IPL emits high-energy pulses of light directly at the hair roots and destroys them preventing the hair from growing. This is very similar to LHE except IPL is less uncomfortable. The advantages and disadvantages of IPL are similar to LHE.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In my professional opinion, I would recommend electrolysis for removal of hair on the face, and laser (SpaTouch being my preference) for any other part of the body, especially legs and underarms. Shaving and hair removal creams should be avoided as they encourage hair re-growth and are not beneficial to the skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
