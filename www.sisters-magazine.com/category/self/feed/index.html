		<description><![CDATA[Fatima shares a few easy ways to manage stress, with these simple but effective tips.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As human beings, we all experience stress in our everyday lives. Stress of school, work, raising kids, juggling a million and one things in a day, can cause an immense amount of stress on our bodies and minds. I’ve always been over-stressed many times, but as I’ve grown older I have begun to realise more and more that there are ways to cope with and potentially reduce the stresses in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some ways I like to work on and manage my stress:<br />
<span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>1. Walk away</strong></span></p>
<p>I love to take breaks at work every hour or so, even if it’s for just a few minutes. Walking to the coffee machine or using the bathroom are my usual escapes. I find that it really helps to clear your head and gives you a few minutes to just think of something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>2. Just breathe</strong></span></p>
<p>So simple, but something I am not always mindful of when I feel the stress overwhelming me. Stopping for a few minutes to focus simply on your breathing can calm your brain and thoughts for a few moments and let you refocus your attention to what’s at hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>3. Wake up earlier</strong></span></p>
<p>I’ve always preferred to wake up early and get to work early, so I can leave early and get home with enough time to still have a few hours to myself to do other things. Being Muslim also aids in this, as waking up for fajr allows for waking up early and starting your day on the right foot. I find that it helps me start my day better by prayer, rather than running late and stressing out even before my day begins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>4. Take your lunch break</strong></span></p>
<p>It’s so sad and terrible to see so many people in the working world, who do not take proper lunch breaks or eat at their desks staring at their computer screen. I always try to take my lunch break because it’s SO necessary! It’s the best time for your mind to relax and think about other things, rather than all the stresses of life. Of course, some days it can be hard to take a full hour or half hour break, but studies do show the positive effects of taking a lunch break at work. It’s necessary to take a mental break and it will let you recharge for the afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>5. Stretch</strong></span></p>
<p>Again, highly recommended for your health too. Just going to the bathroom, a walk outside during lunch, or even a few steps to get your body moving, helps your posture and body. It helps alleviate muscles and can help you refocus your energy to what’s important!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>6. Say No</strong></span></p>
<p>We all need a break at some point! Don’t overwork yourself to the point that you burn out. It’s important to realise what you can handle and how much, at a time. If you’re in school, have exams to study for, or are involved in tons of extracurricular and community events, sometimes it’s best to step back and realise what is a priority and what you may need to say no to for the time being. It is okay to say no and push back at times, because your mental health is the most important thing. There is no need to add stress by taking on more than you can handle!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few starting points to get your life de-stressed. Try incorporating a variety of these things and see how they help change your daily life for the better!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Khurshid Khatib looks at how incorporating regular acts of charity in our lives can become a means of spiritual self-purification.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s 8:40 a.m., and my young son and I should have left the house ten minutes ago. Somehow, despite being awoken at a ridiculously early time, we are going to be late for school &#8211; again. There is a morning void, I’m sure of it &#8211; I call it ‘the lost time zone’, in which keys, shoes and coats inexplicably vanish, just when you need them. The frown on my forehead spreads across my face and, exasperated, I sigh in frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Smile, Mummy,” my son requests, and I am suddenly reminded of one of the most basic acts of charity:<br />
“Your smile for your brother is charity” <em>(Fiqh-us-Sunnah, Volume 3, Number 98)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grin in spite of myself, the mood immediately lifted somewhat, and my son beams straight back. The smallest charitable action within this brief exchange is a simple example of how effective and easy it is to give and how sharing is often also reciprocated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charity, or Zakat, is an Islamic obligation, with the literal meaning of ‘purity’ and is one of the five pillars of belief in Islam. Muslims are required to give two and a half percent of their wealth in zakat each year, which is to be paid on the net amount remaining, after all necessary expenses have been considered. The Prophet Muhammad (SAW)  has said; &#8220;Give regular charity, for truly it is a purifier, and be kind to your relatives and acknowledge the rights of the poor, neighbours and those in need who seek your help.&#8221; <em>(Fiqh-us-Sunnah, Volume 3, Number 3)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadaqah is a voluntary charitable donation and can be given at any time. It can also be reflected through the kindness and consideration of others and not only through financial contributions. Abu Hurairah (RA) reported that the Prophet (SAW) said,  “A good word is charity; administering justice between two people is charity”. If someone “performs good deeds and keeps away from evil deeds, then that will be regarded as a charitable deed.&#8221; <em>(Bukhari)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Islamic history gives many examples of women who have demonstrated philanthropic qualities. Zainab Bint Jahsh (RA), a wife and sahabah (companion) of the Prophet (SAW) was renowned for her generous nature; she would use the earnings made from selling her handiwork to spend on the needy. She became known as ‘The Mother of the Poor’, through reaching the most vulnerable in society, in particular, orphans and widows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Queen Zubayda, the wife of the ninth century Caliph Harun Ar-Rasheed of the Abbasid dynasty, was a well-educated and influential woman. She used her immense wealth to build a large number of wells to vastly improve the route that pilgrims took when travelling from Iraq to Makkah. Following her Hajj pilgrimage, Zubayda also observed the scarcity of water around areas of ‘Arafat and Mina and used her resources to build a canal. This canal provided free drinking water, continuing to do so for over a thousand years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As royalty, Queen Zubayda enjoyed the privileges that came with her lifestyle but was also aware of her people’s needs and recognised the responsibilities that automatically came with financial prosperity. Acquiring wealth is often regarded negatively, but it is greed for money, rather than money itself, which can become a source of trouble amongst us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the ninth century, Fatima al-Fihri of Fez, Morocco used her substantial inheritance (following the death of her husband and brothers) to found the al Qarawiyyin Mosque, which later became the oldest degree-granting University in the world. Her legacy was, and still is, the gift of education. Similarly, her sister Maryam used her own wealth to build the Al-Andalus Mosque, also in Fez.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Islam places particular emphasis on intention in all our actions, and this is to be remembered when giving zakat. It is best to give discreetly, remembering that our deeds are between Allah (SWT) and ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scholar Ibn Taymiyyah said, ‘The soul of one who gives Zakat is blessed and so is his wealth’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #d69a72;">“The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.”</span></em></strong>  <em>(Al-Baqarah:261)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sharing of wealth is also a lesson in humility. When we give to the needy, we are not only acknowledging their suffering and hopefully alleviating some of their hardships; we are also realising empathy in our hearts. It is easy to be conscious of what is lacking in our lives and make comparisons with those who appear to have more that we do, and this is one of the reasons why charity has been likened to spiritual purification. Genuine and frequent charitable acts will cultivate a habit of gratefulness for the positive aspects of our lives, that perhaps we had not previously recognised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How we spend our good fortune is a test of character; we can enjoy the benefits of having wealth, but at the same time remain mindful of our roles within society and the contributions that we can make to improve it. Whilst it is an important duty to endeavour to provide for your family and loved ones, it must be remembered that those of us that have a roof over our heads and regular food on the table are already rich.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also been advised to &#8220;Be in this life as if you were a stranger or a traveller on a path&#8221; <em>(Ibn Umar)</em>. This is a reminder that our lives are a journey; as travellers, we do not require or become attached to an excess of worldly goods. When we genuinely free ourselves from the love of possessions and realise that everything comes from Allah (SWT), we accept that all of our belongings are, effectively, on a short-term loan; these belongings are as temporary as our mortal lives here on earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I rummage around for missing items, yet again during ‘the lost time zone’, with the clock ticking away in the background, I realise that this last hadith is one that my son and I would benefit from by putting into practice. I may choose to blame an imaginary metaphysical void in time, but perhaps this is easier than admitting that I have too many items scattered about my house! Well, they do say that charity begins at home&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Life coach, Sayeda Habib explains the concept of love languages so we can enhance the love we all experience day to day. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Assalaamu &#8216;alaikum sisters! I imagine you’ll agree with me when I say that one desire that we share is the desire to be loved. I’ve yet to meet a sister who hasn’t wanted to feel loved; yet, many of us feel unloved a great deal of the time. This isn’t because we don’t have people who love us. Instead, we feel unloved because we are not recognising the way in which someone is loving us. Confused yet? I imagine you may be. Let me explain through Sister Rashida’s* example. She came to coaching because she was struggling in her marriage; she felt that her husband didn’t love her at all. He would take care of all her material needs, make sure she and the kids were looked after, yet she felt unloved. When we began exploring a bit further, she began to understand that she felt love when it was expressed in words such as “I love you” or “you look beautiful”. However, her husband’s way of expressing love was by doing things for her. He did small things for her around the house, made sure that she didn’t want for anything &#8211; that was his way of showing love. In time, she began to understand that his way of expressing love was different to hers; he loved her a great deal, but in the way that he knew how to love. She learnt how to teach him about her needs and appreciate his gestures more as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love is both complicated and simple. The complex part involves enhancing self-confidence and feeling worthy of receiving love; this is about our relationship with ourselves. The simple part of love is about expressing love for others and fully receiving the love that’s coming our way. We have explored self-esteem before and we will again. However, this time, our focus is on the simple part of love. Focus in on the people who are most important to you. Would you like them to truly feel the love you have for them? Would you like to feel deeply loved and appreciated by them? Today, we will learn about how we can enhance our experience of emotional love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Begin by asking yourself the following questions:<br />
• On a scale of 1-10, how loved am I feeling right now?<br />
• Who are the people who I feel love me the most?<br />
• How do I know (and feel) that they love me? (What do I see, feel, hear and experience that tells me that they love me?)<br />
• Are there times I don’t experience feeling loved? Why or why not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expressing love is a need for us through all of our relationships, whether with our parents, siblings, friends or spouse. Let’s think of expressing love as a form of communication, one that we will think of as our love language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>So what is a love language?</strong></span><br />
Let’s go back to Communication 101 for a moment. The first thing we think of as communication are the words we speak. Our words, in fact, make up a very small percentage of our overall communication. The way people communicate includes their body language, vibes, actions, words and even thoughts. So, the ways in which we express/experience love can be termed as our “love language”. This includes our thoughts, actions, body language and words around expressing love. Just as every human being has their unique way of thinking about life, they also have their preferred way of feeling and expressing love. Choose one relationship in your life where you want to feel more loved and then take this short quiz to start exploring your love language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I feel really wonderful when<br />
A. I’m told I am loved or appreciated.<br />
B. My family or loved ones spend uninterrupted quality time with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I feel more loved when<br />
A. I’m given words of encouragement.<br />
B. My loved one helps me with the housework or does something I need done (without me having to ask).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I truly feel loved when<br />
A. My loved one tells me I did a great job with a meal.<br />
B. They give me a gift or a card just for no reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I feel more loved when<br />
A. When I hear “I love you”.<br />
B. When I get a hug or my loved one holds my hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. I feel more loved when<br />
A. I hear loving and encouraging words.<br />
B. I get a card, a flower or a gift for no reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loving words: If you found yourself ticking “A” most often, then you experience love when you’re encouraged through words. You need to hear encouragement for your efforts and be told that you’re loved. If this is the way you feel love, then you express it in this way as well. If you find yourself saying “I love you” then it could be your primary desire to hear these words too. Encouragement and being told you’re loved goes a long way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Quality time:</strong></span> If you selected that, then you truly feel loved when people spend time with you. This doesn’t mean sitting with you while on the phone; instead, you want to feel that you have your loved one’s or friend’s real attention. They look at you and listen to you. You feel heard and that’s when you feel a sense of being loved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Acts of service:</strong></span> If you prefer that your son keeps his room clean or your husband takes the garbage out without being asked, then your preferred way of feeling loved is this one. You feel loved when people do things that you need done. You may also be doing things for them to show them that you care. If this is your way of feeling love, then you probably express it in the same way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Gifts:</strong> </span>If you feel on top of the world when you get a rose or a card, then this is the way you feel truly loved. You may be one of those people who loves giving small gifts as a surprise &#8211; if your friends give you something, whatever it is, you cherish it. Receiving gifts doesn’t mean that they need to be expensive, it’s the thought that counts &#8211; and a small token goes a long way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Physical touch:</strong> </span>Are you someone who hugs your family and friends a lot? Then you prefer to experience love by receiving the same. It may be that your special someone holds your hand or touches your arm as they walk by. Small gestures of touch allow you to feel loved and keep you fulfilled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all have a combination of ways in which we feel love. The idea here is to explore which is the one you most prefer. Ask your loved ones to take the test and you may find the results surprising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Tip:</strong> Give love &#8211; but in their language</span><br />
Now you can begin to explain to your loved ones what you need to feel loved. Next, learn about your family members&#8217; or spouse’s preferred love language. Learn one or two new ways in which you can express your love, but in the way that they prefer. This will impact your relationship in a wonderful way. When your loved ones feel fulfilled, they will also want to give the love back &#8211; you can teach them about what you need as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that you found the quiz insightful and useful as well. Insha Allah we can all enhance our experience of love. First learn to love through your loved ones’ preferred ways and then gently request of them to care for you in the small ways you need. My warmest wishes for you on this wonderful and heartwarming journey.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Khadijah Stott-Andrew discusses the flaws and benefits of the different approaches to problem solving. 
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emotions are something everyone experiences, even if we prefer not to advertise them. Contrary to popular belief, internal emotional conflict is not specific to one particular gender. Emotions stem from chemical hormones in the body &#8211; something all of mankind were created with. What sets us apart, male or female, is how we process them. It is often assumed that there are only two ways to face these feelings:</p>
<p>1. Practically and rationally.<br />
2. Succumbing to the emotions without logical thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, is it really this black and white? Or is it possible to handle situations rationally whilst also nurturing sensitivities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to think that there was no way to do both. I was a young creature of feeling and constantly allowed my hormones to guide my actions, wishing I could be logical but believing it to be impossible. Exposure to certain ideas, whether reading books or watching movies, had convinced me that there was no alternative way to handle my problems other than to “follow my heart” and do what “feels right”. This methodology obscured my judgement and lead me into many unnecessary conflicts, purely because I was acting on my feelings, rather than the facts at hand. And that is how I lived for most of my life. That is until I got married. The natural and expected discord I experienced in those early days encouraged me to approach problem solving in a different manner. I learnt to take a step back from my emotions to look at a problem logically, whilst still accepting and coping with any emotional turmoil that came my way. I have learnt to recognise whether my reactions are based on an emotional trigger or a logical one. When about to start a heated discussion, my husband will often hear me say, “I’m all hormonal at the moment, sorry!” and I will give myself some space to work through my emotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #72aba0;"><strong>Keeping emotions in check </strong></span><br />
“How do you know the difference between a logical reaction and a physiological one?” I have been asked. I’m not saying I always make the correct judgment call, not by a long shot, but I tend to realise when I am being irrational once I sit down and think (or write!) through my problem. Once I see there is no logical reason for my level of upset, I can put the issue down to my emotions. Sometimes I find I have a genuine concern and the problem needs to be addressed, but my response has been an overreaction and has even hindered the solutions at hand. This is when a logical approach is imperative. When this happens, I give myself a day to cool down and choose something to help cheer me up. When I am no longer stressed by the problem, I think it through again. This usually has two outcomes &#8211; either I am no longer bothered or even see it as a problem, or I have a greater clarity of mind to engage in a productive and useful solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #72aba0;"><strong>Don’t suppress!</strong></span><br />
I am by no means encouraging the habit of ignoring our emotions or suppressing problems. Just because we are attempting to control and manage emotions, does not mean we are denying their validity. You must still acknowledge that you are upset and allow yourself to feel that emotion, without adding guilt or shame into the mix. Whether the problem is the situation or your reaction, something needs addressing and deserves equal attention. Learn to accept that being unhappy and distressed is OK, and sometimes we even need to cry for no reason other than to detox our minds. Feeling guilty for crying can sometimes fuel negative emotions and pull you down even further, magnifying your problems. Even now I still fall into the trap of scolding myself for “unnecessary crying”. This self-abuse intensifies the calamity and even destroys the strength you need to pick yourself back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #72aba0;"><strong>Managing emotions effectively</strong></span><br />
Like anything, there are clear steps you can take to solve a problem you have. It is recommended to practice these steps whilst calm and with a clear mind. Just like breathing exercises should be mastered in order to be useful during times of stress, these steps must be practised to help you follow them through smoothly when they are truly needed. Remembering these steps structures your thoughts during a time when emotional upset is attempting to cloud your judgement. Dr. Darlene Mininni addresses appropriate emotional management in her book, The Emotional Toolkit. Dr. Mininni explains the importance of identifying your exact emotion before tackling it. To do this, she divides emotions into four categories:</p>
<p><strong><em>Anxiety</em></strong> &#8211; often accompanied by thoughts of “what if&#8230;?” as you worry about things that could go wrong.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sadness</em></strong> &#8211; includes negative thoughts along with a heavy, tired feeling. Often you might cry or have trouble concentrating.</p>
<p><strong><em>Anger</em></strong> &#8211; angry thoughts are usually focused on ways that you or even your values have been attacked.</p>
<p><strong><em>Happiness</em></strong> &#8211; when you’re happy, your mind is focused on things you have gained and you’ll feel light and calm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once identified, you can then address the emotion by asking yourself what the message of the emotion is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anxiety &#8211; What am I afraid of?<br />
Sadness &#8211; What have I lost?<br />
Anger &#8211; How have I/my values been attacked?<br />
Happiness &#8211; What have I gained?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have calculated an answer to these questions (again, writing out your thoughts would be massively therapeutic and help you focus) you can begin to work out what actions you wish to take in order to manage the problem you find yourself with. Sometimes, you might even find that there is no way for you to handle the situation &#8211; there is a chance it could be completely out of your hands. In this case, you can focus your attention on coping with the emotion you’re feeling and working through it. For example, by acknowledging your anger, you can attempt to manage it through deep breathing or even meditation. Maintaining awareness of an emotion will better equip you to deal with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The techniques you will use to cope with your emotions will be completely unique to yourself. Whether you prefer to read a book, go shopping with a friend or just tuck into a slice of cake, there is one extra technique that we should all utilise relentlessly. The Mercy, Majesty and ultimate Power of Allah (SWT) is a blessing we should never ignore. There are numerous verses in the Noble Qur’an where Allah (SWT) provides beautiful words of comfort for painful or upsetting situations. It can be hugely uplifting to reflect on these verses, research the <em>tafsir</em> (explanations) and gain a deeper understanding of the words of our Lord. After all, Allah I is the One who has presented us with our trials and problems, and He is the only One who can bring us safely out of them again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ J. Samia Mair offers valuable tips for coping with difficult family members.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Toxic” can be defined as harsh, malicious or harmful, and unfortunately, most of us have encountered at least one toxic person in our lives. Toxic people can be anyone: a friend, a teacher, a boss or, most difficultly, a family member. It is one thing to quit your job, quite another to quit your family. Dealing with toxic people is never easy and often challenges us emotionally, physically (in the sense of being drained), financially and spiritually. Below are some practicle steps you can try if you find yourself in a toxic relationship. These do not apply to severe emotional or physical abuse, as they should be handled by trained and qualified experts. Also, dealing with children is an entirely different phenomenon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The life lessons of others &#8211; often through years of trial and painful error &#8211; can be useful in helping to deal with the less severe situations that may arise with the toxic adults in your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Don&#8217;t expect the toxic person to change. Expect and accept that he or she will not change. But you can change how you react to toxic situations and what toxic situations you are in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
2. Don&#8217;t expect anything from anyone &#8211; yes, have no expectations from others, but great expectations for yourself. In other words, do your duty towards that person, but don&#8217;t expect that person to do his or her duty towards you. For example, make the intention that you are trying to maintain family ties for the sake of Allah (SWT), even if that person rejects your overtures or makes it impossible for you to maintain a relationship. Fulfill your duty with the knowledge that you will be accountable to Allah (SWT), regardless of anyone else’s behaviour. In order to do this, you must know what your duties are to others, and they change depending upon who the other actor is. For example, your duty to a family member is far more extensive than your duty to a friend. There is a great deal of Islamic scholarship on this issue, which is readily available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Ignore the bad behaviour when possible &#8211; behaviour that doesn&#8217;t hurt you, your spouse, your children etc. In other words, pick your battles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Do not allow yourself to be used, abused or belittled. This might require setting up boundaries &#8211; how long you interact with that person, where you interact, limiting the types of conversations that are conducted in front of your children etc. People have triggers and mostly predictable behaviour. Identify those triggers and seek to eliminate them. For example, if there is a topic of conversation that always sets a toxic person off, do not discuss that topic with him or her. Some relationships might require more extensive and restrictive measures than others; thus, your response must be tailored to the particular situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Deal gently with that toxic person, as gentleness is one of the noblest traits in Islam. This will not be easy, as it is not easy to be kind in the face of abusive or hurtful behaviour. Try to remember the importance of gentleness in all matters, and recount the many beautiful examples of our beloved Prophet (SAW) in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. With respect to a toxic family member, realise that Allah (SWT) has placed you in this particular family for a reason. There are certain family members you would not choose to be friends with, and perhaps you do not like them at all. But Allah (SWT), through His Infinite Wisdom, has chosen to connect you through familial ties and that, even if you cannot understand it, somehow is good for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>&#8220;Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not.&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Baqarah: 216)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Realise that Allah (SWT) does not place a burden on us more than we can bear. Try to think of the benefits of having a relationship with that family member, even if it is simply learning that you do not want to behave like that person. Difficult people teach us patience, unconditional love and forgiveness. Try to embrace how you have grown by having that person in your life, and accept that Allah (SWT) knows best what is good for you in this life to get you to your ultimate goal in the Hereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Make du’a for that person. When you ask Allah (SWT) for good things for someone, your heart softens towards them. Ironically, I first heard that from an atheist family member and it is part of Islam as well. You can also ask Allah (SWT) to forgive him or her for any bad deeds done to you. You can even ask that if you get a good deed from something bad that person has done to you, you can give that good deed back to that person as sadaqah. Know that it is possible to love someone that does not love you or even has disdain for you. Loving someone without expecting love in return is true love. Also know that you can love someone but not like that person; you can even dislike him or her. It only takes your love to soften your heart towards someone. It may seem impossible now, but it is possible. Do not expect your feelings towards that person to change overnight. It is a long process from wanting to rid yourself of anger and resentment and internalising it in your heart. Depending on the type of relationship and level of toxicity, it could take years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. While you’re at it, ask Allah (SWT) to forgive you for the bad deeds that you have done to that person. Chances are your behaviour hasn’t been spotless either!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Expect setbacks. You might be handling the situation very well for a while, but then you regress. That&#8217;s OK. Just regroup and move forward again. Dealing with toxic people requires constant “pep talks” to yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Know that you are not alone, and other people have gone through similar challenges before you. There is a wealth of advice to be gained from others’ experiences, and there really is that proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. But, of course, if you are in a severe emotionally or physically abusive situation, seek help from the experts and those qualified to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Detox” means “to remove a harmful toxin or render it harmless”. It is not always possible or advisable to sever ties with certain people, even if they happen to be “toxic”. But, you can change the situation and alter the dynamics so that their toxicity is virtually harmless to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anas (RA) reported that the Prophet (SAW) said, &#8220;Anyone who possesses three attributes will experience the sweetness of belief: that he loves Allah and His Messenger more than anything else; that he loves someone for the sake of Allah alone; and that he hates the idea of reverting to disbelief as much as he would hate being thrown into a fire.&#8221; <em>(Agreed upon)</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Tara Alomari discusses our diet and how we can gain benefits by adopting the ancient Paleo diet.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an anthropology class years ago, my professor began by stating that paleo-humans (the people living 10,000+ years ago) were the healthiest in human history.  That small fact intrigued me and stayed with me, pushing me to re-imagine our ancient ancestors and the reality of our modern world.  Thus, when recently I heard about the Paleo diet, I just had to find out more about this radical and sometimes controversial diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When most of us try to imagine the lives of the first people, back before the Iron Age or the Bronze Age, back before the agricultural revolution when most people were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, we tend to evoke a rather bleak image of those people’s lives: hunting giant beasts with rudimentary weapons, collecting a few roots and berries and barely surviving through winter and famine to perpetuate the existence of the species.  Contrary to popular belief, however, anthropologists are increasingly arguing that, based on accumulating evidence such as bones and dental records, Paleo Man was actually more robust and healthy than the average person today and for a variety of reasons, including their diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The Paleo diet and lifestyle is based on the idea of eating in a way that is similar to our paleo-ancestors, which works well within a modern context.  It is argued that such a diet best serves the needs of our bodies and leads to optimal health because it provides the right balance of organic foods which we are genetically wired to process, use and store in the most efficient manner. Humans are naturally omnivores; we are able to eat from a wide range of food sources, including many plants and animals and even some fungi. Therefore, the Paleo diet draws not only on anthropology, but on modern research in epigenetics and human development to argue for a diet that is rich in protein, fruits and vegetables and low in grains (carbohydrates) and sugar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paleo is often considered to be a variety of the low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet in that it stresses a reduction in the consumption of carbohydrates.  However, unlike Atkins, it lays more stress on the health and environmental importance of eating free-range and organic meat and eggs and also advocates not eating vegetable oils.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Allah has commanded us, in multiple places in the Qur&#8217;an, to eat not only what is halal, but also what is tayyib, which can be understood as what is good, wholesome and pure.  In modern terminology, that could translate as organic, meaning free of poisonous pesticides, hormones, antibiotics and artificial additives. In the case of our meat, animals should have space to roam, be well treated and fed a diet which is consistent with their natural disposition (i.e., not fed the products of other animals or synthetic mixes designed to make them fat). Eating what is tayyib is the heart and soul of the Paleo diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by the critics’ (and some zealous proponents’) over-emphasis of meat consumption.  In fact, a well balanced Paleo diet will include lots and lots of fresh fruit and veggies.  While the Paleo diet is also by no means vegetarian, the important thing to remember is that, when it comes to meat, quality (organic, free range) is far more important than quantity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It is for this reason that the Paleo diet tends to demonise grains (which are our primary source of carbohydrates), and particularly processed grain products like flour and its many by-products.  What most people today do not realise is that what we consider to be an average Western diet is actually significantly more carb-dense than the human diet has been for most of history.  Furthermore, once something has been processed to the point that it becomes pure white powder, it has become a nutritional desert and should be avoided (fun fact: the term “empty calories” was actually created to describe breakfast cereal). Some evidence suggests that our paleo-ancestors did eat a variety of starches, particularly from roots, maize and other varieties of grain. Their sources were significantly more nutrient-rich than most modern varieties of corn and wheat and they still did not eat nearly as much of it as the average person today. This diet places an emphasis on freshness, nutrients and minimising the consumption of highly processed foods rather than eliminating grains and starches from our diets altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What also impressed me about this diet is the general lack of branded “Paleo” products.  Unlike many famous diets, it has not spawned legions of extremely profitable bars, shakes, membership fees, etc.  The only people who profit from promoting the Paleo diet, besides a handful of Paleo diet book authors, are small scale organic farms and farmers’ markets.  It’s not being made into a big business because that would be inherently antithetical to the Paleo lifestyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Paleo diet does not argue for us to all go back to being hunter-gatherers, which would be neither desirable nor really possible at this point.  However, the grain (or bone marrow) of wisdom in this diet and lifestyle is that we need a return to purity in our diets; to eat the good of this earth in all its many natural sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in 2008 I wrote an article titled <em>Living the Single Life, </em>which detailed my personal journey from being an unmarried woman, obsessed with the idea of marriage, to being an unmarried woman content with Allah&#8217;s Will, and committed to making the most of the blessings her single status affords her. The article really did its rounds on the Internet and I was amazed at how many sisters contacted me to say they had drawn comfort from it. What really struck me was that most of these sisters were in their early to mid-twenties.</p>

<p>This really got me thinking: it is not only sisters 25 plus who allow themselves to get sidetracked by their &#8216;unmarried plight&#8217;; it seems that most Muslim women, regardless of their age, feel – at some point or the other – disadvantaged, or even inferior if they are unmarried.</p>

<p>For the sister who wallows in self-pity and pessimistic thoughts such as, &#8216;I&#8217;m never going to meet the right person,&#8217; and &#8216;What if I&#8217;m alone for the rest of my life?&#8217; I have the following advice: REFRAME your situation. Instead of thinking, &#8216;There is nobody out there for me&#8217;, think, &#8216;There&#8217;s somebody out there for me, but before I meet and marry him, Allah wants me to make the most of the time He&#8217;s blessed me with.&#8217; And why not be even more courageous? Instead of asking, &#8216;What if I&#8217;m alone for the rest of my life,&#8217; ask, &#8216;SO WHAT if I&#8217;m alone for the rest of my life?&#8217;</p>

<div class="column">
<p>There’s a photo of me, aged 4, running at the bottom of my Granny’s lane. I remember it being taken: my uncle had said, “Run for me, you’re the girl who loves to run.”</p>

<p>I duly did as he asked and the picture in black and white is truly a great one, despite being staged. It is the epitome of childhood careless freedom, me running in a sundress, the picture framed by huge trees and the hill climbing up behind me, my arms in mid swing and a genuine look of exhilaration on my face. I did win lots of sprints at primary school, and later in secondary school I took part in the mandatory cross country runs in PE which left us with mud-sodden clothes and trainers, and numb hands. I still don’t know why the cross country season was held at the coldest possible time of the year but cold and all, I always enjoyed the push up the first hill, the feeling of everyone falling back, dropping away, and just running on alone with determined abandon. I did compete at cross country but not with any remarkable results. Then I unintentionally steered away from running and got into netball until I finished school, and that was the end of my running for a long time.</p>

<p>Aside from one occasion in the midst of my teenage years when a distressing situation came up and I remember waking up uncharacteristically early one weekend morning and just thinking, I have to run.</p>

<p>And I ran up the road in the countryside on a beautiful May morning and it soothed and calmed me. That was a random moment, but I should have taken it with me as a way to empty my mind, get away from my thoughts or to push worry or stress out of my system.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only took up running again aged 30 after my second baby. I joined a gym and ambled around it looking at the various machines, idly wondering about many of them. Then I saw the treadmill and thought, I can do that. Of course it wasn’t that easy. It was nigh on 14 years since I had run properly so the first few times were quite pitiful, slow and puffy, but it didn’t take that long to get back into my stride. Some people run to burn calories but that’s not my bag. I see the calorie counter on the treadmill, but the figures mean nothing to me. Mine wasn’t a weight issue; I wanted above all to be fit and to move, fast. I love the feeling of getting the blood pumping around my body, the feeling that I am, insha Allah, delivering oxygen to every cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I am dedicated to anything on the running machine it has to be the time: I feel like I have failed if I don’t run for at least 30 minutes. About six months after my third baby was born last year, my first ‘post baby’ run was interspersed with me talking to myself, “If you can have a baby, you can run this 5K.” Actually, I do mutter to myself quite a bit when the going gets tough, get stuck in a running rut. It’s hard, it’s unglamorously sweaty and red-faced, but it feels so great when it’s done. In my present, very blessed but hectic world of small children and everything that goes with them I cherish my running and how it allows me to escape and achieve something in a tiny time frame. It pays out and stays with me in a way in which, let’s face it, housework never will.</p>

<div class="page" title="Page 23">

<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only gripe is that I wish I could run more every week &#8211; insha Allah, more time will come up. I see it as taking care of the body and mind that I’ve been given. It rejuvenates me and recharges my batteries. Mostly, I listen to podcasts while I am running &#8211; just being able to take the time to do that with no other pressing commitments or little voices drowning out the sound is a luxury. Also, running doesn’t demand any great expertise; you are, after all, just moving your legs so the opportunity to zone out and switch off is there. There is no need for any great concentration or co-ordination, you just keep going. Some people find increased motivation from being in exercise classes and the encouragement of a group to work together. I like the solitude of running alone.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>My must-haves for a run</strong></span><br />
• A good pair of proper running trainers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Sweat bands for your head and wrists. This is a comfort issue: you need to wipe away that sweat.</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• A squeezy sports water bottle that you can just suck from whilst running. An ordinary bottle is surprisingly difficult, verging on the hazardous, to drink from whilst on the move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• A heart rate monitor. Ok, I hate to get all technical but these are great, although admittedly not necessarily a ‘must have.’ Depending on your gender, age and weight, you have a heart rate ‘zone’ within which it is best to stay for the optimum aerobic training. Basically, this ensures you are getting the most out of what you are doing. It’s also quite fascinating to get in touch with your heart this way!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• A podcast. I will admit that it can get boring while you are trying to notch up the kilometres and this can be demotivating so, if you have something interesting going on in your ears, from an audiobook to a lecture, so much the better.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Timea Csanyi explains why creativity is healthy for everyone and how to go about finding yours.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, I got the idea to surprise my family with some little gifts as a means of expressing my thankfulness and love for them. What could be more personal than making something with your own hands? So, after successfully completing my treasure hunting at the hobby shop by acquiring several acrylic paints, a paint brush, a few colourful décor pearls and prefabricated wood projects, I started working on my ‘masterpieces’. It took several days and much effort as I haven’t held a paintbrush in my hand for ages, but it was definitely worth it! Not only because everyone was moved by my initiative, but also because I truly enjoyed the creative process itself, I realised how much I missed having handicrafts in my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, humans are born creative. For a child with a limitless imagination, spinning incredible stories, imitating a character or building awesome constructions from Lego are some of the most enjoyable things to do, and truly they are essential activities in their development. During the emotionally chaotic years of teens and young adults, creativity becomes a way of self-exploration for most of us as it helps us to realise our habits, impulses and desires, helping us to better express ourselves to the world. Creativity also empowers us while reducing stress and anxiety. It aids us to overcome periods of depression and increases our positive thoughts, giving a nice boost to our self-esteem. And the procedure works vice-versa: the more happy and relaxed we feel, the more creative we become.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for many, when adulthood comes along with its responsibilities, the lack of time and constant tiredness, that childhood imagination is blown away. We easily become stuck in a rut, such as between work and home or a crying toddler and demanding housework. We stop nurturing our soul by practising at being creative, which used to smuggle some refreshing moments into our busy days. Little do we know that being creative wouldn’t only improve our overall well-being and optimism, but &#8211; according to studies &#8211; would also sharpen our brain, and make us be more social and enjoy better health in our elder years. Instead, artistic endeavours become seen as pointless, time-wasting activities despite the many benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
You might argue now that actually you’re clumsy and cannot draw even a single straight line, but if you think further, the world of creativity is so wide and can be applied to many areas. Even in our everyday routine, we need to use our vivid imagination quite often; dressing up in the morning, preparing meals, coming up with an original initiative at work or helping children understand their homework, just to mention a few, all require being innovative aka creative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Islam’s history provides us with outstanding examples of ingenuity, particularly in the early period of Islam which was full of talented Muslims who gifted the world with numerous inventions. Muslims have formed lasting memories not only in education or science (both of which require creative thinking to excel at), but also immensely in the field of art, such as the Lusterware ceramic and the Ebru painting art or Islamic calligraphy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, the correct question you need to ask yourself, that was posed by Sir Ken Robinson, is “…it’s not how creative you are. It’s … how are you creative?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e6055b;"><strong>Get inspired!</strong></span><br />
You have carved out a little personal time, set up your workspace and are ready to refresh your soul by enjoying this time with your creative self. The only problem is that it seems you’ve lost your muse. You’re striving, but the inspiration apparently doesn’t want to come. Well, you don’t have to wait for your musings to gift you with some brilliant ideas; you can be creative by using several tricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• First, you need to switch on your “curiosity button” and be on the watch for new ideas all the time. Remember, being creative is being open-minded, noticing things that others might not, looking at things from another angle and asking the question “How else?” In fact, acquiring the art of being open-minded will also help you to be open to new ways and techniques in other areas of life as well. Thus, constantly questioning and analysing things around you and paying attention to even little details will produce some inspiration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• But don’t just look for ideas &#8211; try out something unusual, too! It might be a new flavour or a new technique; it doesn’t matter where you work this newness into your life, just get out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Though creating relaxes us, relaxing and meditation also positively affect our creative process. Hence, take some deep breaths or pray two rak’ah with complete focus to calm yourself down, thereby facilitating the flow of your thoughts to eventually receive the desired inspiration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Instead of meditating a few minutes, you can go for a walk as well (even inside the house) or try some stretching. Move! Statistics say that physical activity stimulates creative thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Usually, when people create, they prefer solitude to be able to reflect and be fully immersed in their work. But you can shake up your routine from time to time by getting together with friends or other like-minded sisters. Socialising is not only fun and needed for your soul’s harmony, but also gives you the opportunity to discuss your notions and get further inspiration for your project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>•  Now that you have a bunch of sparkly thoughts in your pocket, don’t just wander aimlessly, rushing from one idea to another. Create a detailed plan; it will help you stay focused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• However, first and foremost, you must feel the power of passion and fall in love with what you do so that you can put yourself truly in that work. Try things that you really want to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e6055b;"><strong>Explore your creativity!</strong></span><br />
Okay, so you feel the desire to get into something creative but not sure what best suits you. Below, I have collected some ideas which can help you explore your innovative self and enjoy your free time in a halal way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Writing: SISTERS, as an example, is just one among the hundreds of platforms where sisters with much enthusiasm for writing can express themselves. You can start writing for different magazines and websites, blogging, or opening your writing vein in the more literary genres, pouring out novels or poems on to the page (or hard drive!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Handy Sisters: Aniconic painting and sculpturing, photography, knitting and sewing, designing clothes and accessories and making handmade jewelry or home decor are only a few techniques on the endless list of handicrafts which can be deeply satisfying to make and can even be employed to create original Islamic work pieces. (Have a look on Etsy for inspiration.) You can make basically anything yourself &#8211; and often even save some money at the same time! The more you learn how to make things yourself, the less you need to spend money on buying them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Singing Birds: Though as Muslims we face some restrictions in the field of music, there are still halal ways to follow your enthusiasm in a beneficial way. Learning and teaching the correct recitation of the Qur’an to other sisters or organising an afternoon class for preschoolers singing Islamic nasheeds might be options to consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Fantastic Foodies: If the world of spices and cake pans is attractive to you (unlike me) and you want to challenge yourself, you may want to sell your masterpieces in a charity fundraising auction or start your own project with other kitchen fairy sisters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, whatever you commit to, it’s important never to compare yourself to others. Just remember to purify your intention in front of Allah (SWT), then have fun and enjoy the mind and soul-refreshing effect of creativity!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Nahida Esmail takes an in-depth look at narcissistic personality disorder and society's obsession with themselves.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know of people who always seek attention? Do you have friends that always want to be the center of attraction? Do these friends get easily frustrated when they are not? Do they sometimes act desperately for attention? Do they crave an audience to such an extent that they sometimes use excessive or inappropriate behaviors?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, it is normal to look for validation every now and then. Human beings are social by nature and want to be noticed as a way of being accepted or supported. However, when the attention seeking behaviour steps beyond the normal boundaries then it can become dangerous. In that case you are looking at the new disorder that I would like to call the ‘Mirror Mirror on the Facebook Wall’ personality. And surely it is on the rise! There are many factors that lead to this behaviour and one of those factors can be the ease and speed of social media. I have met too many people like this recently, so I decided to investigate this type of personality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s first look at where the classical phrase of “Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of us all?” comes from. It was used by the evil queen step-mother in the fairy tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. She possessed a magic mirror and would ask it that question. The mirror would answer honestly and tell her who was the fairest. What she always wanted to hear was, “Queen, thou’rt fairest of them all.” At one point when the mirror informs her that she is not the fairest of all, she is furious and is willing to take steps to make sure she stays the fairest of all, even if this means killing the newly ‘fairest’ Snow White.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what has the evil queen step-mother’s mirror on the wall and the Facebook wall have in common? A lot! We have to first understand the relationship between the evil queen and the mirror in order to establish a link with Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queen was preoccupied with herself, her looks and her fantasy of being the prettiest woman on the face of the earth. She constantly asked the mirror to be assured that she was pretty. No one should surpass her in her beauty. She was seeking out admiration. Her main concern was with outer beauty only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c45c00;"><b>Narcissistic personality disorder</b></span></p>
<p>Well, the queen step-mother could easily be classified as a narcissist. Narcissism is a personality disorder recognized by the American Psychological Association (APA, 2000)[1]. It is marked by grandiose thoughts of oneself, self-absorption and a lack of empathy for others amongst many other behaviors. In order for a person to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) they must meet five or more of these symptoms. (See list below)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c45c00;"><b>Selfies</b></span></p>
<p>Recently, science has linked selfies to Narcissism, Addiction &amp; Low Self Esteem. There are even stories of youth who attempted suicide or otherwise harmed themselves because they did not get the approval and admiration from people of their selfies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you imagine? Posting a selfie on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or any other social outlet and getting so highly distressed for not getting the amount of likes that it leads you to want to end your life? This is a crisis! And a growing one too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c45c00;"><b>Selfies and other personality disorders</b></span></p>
<p>In these cases, selfies can be linked to other personality disorders. For those who spend hours taking a ‘right’ selfie to post on the wall, obsessing that people approve of their looks, this could be an Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). Just like the queen-mother who constantly checked her reflection in the mirror and asked it for its opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Histrionic personality disorder is when there is a need to constantly be the center of attention, over-reacting to problems and being excessively emotional and continuously seeking attention. The queen-mother reacts emotionally and dramatically when the mirror tells her she is not the fairest of all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mind you, Facebook and other media misuse can contribute to other maladies. Facebook addicts are more comfortable checking in and interacting with the outside world from behind the comfort of a manipulated image. The evil queen mother was uncomfortable outside of the castle and most comfortable talking to the mirror. Using social sites excessively can detach one from social relationships, as the person feels more comfortable with the virtual friends and virtual relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c45c00;"><b>A mirror</b></span></p>
<p>What does the mirror represent in Snow White? Well, for one thing, it is surely very honest. We can give much credit to it for casting a true reflection of the evil queen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) stated, “A true believer is a mirror to his brother. He prevents him from any harm.” <em>[Abu Dawood]</em></p>
<p>&#8220;The believer is like a mirror to other believers (in truthfulness).&#8221;<em> [Abu Dawood]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the role of the mirror in Snow White was to inform the evil queen of her outer appearance only. And having taken into account that the evil queen was the fairest of them all for a long time, how did the mirror set the criteria for beauty? Who sets the criteria for beauty? Is outer beauty more important than inner beauty? Well, not according to beauty in the fairytale, <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to be careful of the companions we choose for friendship. But do we know all those that we add on our Facebook wall? These very same people that we choose to validate our lives. And if we don’t get a ‘like’ from this virtual friend, we feel upset! Are your friends as honest as the mirror?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choose friends who will be like a mirror to you. Who will be honest to you. Friends who can draw you closer to your Creator and carve a way for you to Jannah. And don’t depend too much on your friends – virtual or not – to make you feel good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c45c00;"><b>What is the Nafs and the types of Nafs</b></span></p>
<p>Nafs is an Arabic word meaning the self, ego or the soul. The Egyptians have a common phrase that they use to tell you to take care of yourself “<i>Khallibalik min nafsik</i>”. If you look deeper into the meaning it could also mean to take care of your ego, for if it gets out of hand, it will cause you guilt. The <i>nafs</i> of the evil queen gets the better of her when she realizes that she is not the fairest of all in the kingdom. She becomes envious and jealous. Envy is “to desire what another person has”. The queen therefore busies herself day and night to possess what Snow White has, which is ultimate beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People on Facebook spend day and night posting images of themselves or other personal posts so they can get people’s attention. This is when the <i>nafs</i> gets the better of you; making you think that the world revolves around you. Some people post images of everything they do, and this makes other people think that they live a lavish lifestyle, whereas they may not. This leads to insecurity from the part of the person posting and envy on the part of the person reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it is good to tame your <i>nafs</i>. There is nothing wrong with deriving some pleasure from material things so long as you don’t attach to this pleasure and think that your possessions are indicative of who <i>you are</i> or make you a superior person to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your nafs can take you away from the fitrah and purpose of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avoid falling into the ‘Mirror Mirror on the Facebook Wall’ personality trap. You don’t need your ego stroked every few minutes. As a Muslim, learn to have enough self-confidence that you don’t have to depend on people for appraisal. Pride and arrogance will prevent you from entering Paradise. Being envious will not get you what you want. Rather, turn into a productive Muslim, accept and be grateful to the favours that have been bestowed upon you. Try and raise your <i>nafs</i> to be <i>Nafs al-Mutmainah</i> (a self that reaches the ultimate peace). Kill your ego when it gets too attracted and attached to the dunya. Don’t give into consumerism. The world does not revolve around you!</p>

<p>[1]Narcissistic Personality Disorder (<a href="http://psyed.org/r/pers/pt/narcissisticpd.html">http://psyed.org/r/pers/pt/narcissisticpd.html</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, pg. 661) describes Narcissistic Personality Disorder as a pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:</p>
<ul>

<li>is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love;</li>
<li>believes that he or she is &#8220;special&#8221; and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions);</li>
<li>requires excessive admiration;</li>
<li>has a sense of entitlement, i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations;</li>
<li>is interpersonally exploitive, i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends;</li>
<li>lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others;</li>
<li>is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her;</li>

		<description><![CDATA[You’ve found the perfect fiance, everything’s lined up for the wedding, but what if he suddenly calls it off? Reham Omar ackno]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re confused, lost and a little bewildered? Physically sound yet sick to your stomach? Taken aback because you&#8217;ve been oblivious to the signs but, suddenly conscious, struck with clarity? It feels like your heart has been ripped out of your ribcage?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last thing you want to hear is that it gets better because you&#8217;re consumed with an overwhelming pain that clouds any prospect of change or progress. You&#8217;re hurt. It&#8217;s as simple as that and, whether you received the blatant reasons or the &#8220;it&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me&#8221; speech, you&#8217;ll have been thrown off guard and made to feel insecure; a little voice inside of you is probably whispering: &#8220;you weren&#8217;t good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, a part of your life has been revolving around this person. You&#8217;ll spend the next few days, weeks, walking around like a zombie, neither here nor there, still trying to figure things out. There&#8217;s no fighting this, it&#8217;s a part of the grieving process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll fluctuate between moments of lucidity when things make sense and you feel more understanding of the situation, slightly at peace, and moments of panic when you can&#8217;t come to terms with the reality. You may be able to distract yourself momentarily, you&#8217;ll laugh and engage in discussions, but at the end of the day, you&#8217;re left with a void. This void may tempt you to do something reckless in order to fill it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is the decisions we make while at our most vulnerable are a manifestation of our pain, rather than logical, calculated decisions, resulting in more damage in the long run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a break up, a lot of women feel the need to compensate their bruised ego &#8211; getting a makeover, going on holiday etc. Another side effect of this void is the &#8220;rebound factor&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;ll experience a yearning for affection that you were expecting to receive in your future married life. The echo of your planned life together will be loud and resonating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, once you&#8217;ve mustered up enough energy to resume your everyday life and head back to work and function properly, you might have a strangely uplifting day when you feel fine and barely ponder over what&#8217;s happened, but then the bubble bursts because the grief that coincides with a breakup is a difficult process that you have to endure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter how hard people try to sugarcoat or trivialise it, the pain is inevitable and you’ll wonder “what was the point of all this? Why did this person invade my life if only to leave?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no easy answer to this question except that sometimes you have to lose your balance in love to gain balance in life. Everyone will tell you not to let it affect your self-esteem. The truth is that it will, but it’s also true that we need a humbling experience every once in a while to keep us grounded as human beings. In the long run, you&#8217;ll look back and see that in the grand scheme of things, it made sense. This life experience will have an impact on you and it&#8217;s up to you to determine whether it&#8217;s favourable or not. You&#8217;ll be remoulded and for a while you&#8217;ll not feel like yourself, but if you have enough faith in God, you&#8217;ll know that this was for a reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having faith in the Almighty and His providence is what will get you through this; every hardship holds great mercy within. But meanwhile, how do you sustain yourself in this difficult period? Firstly, through supplication. Umm Salamah (RA) reported:  If any servant (of Allah) who suffers a calamity says: &#8220;We belong to Allah and to Him shall we return; O Allah, reward me for my affliction and give me something better than it in exchange for it,&#8221; Allah will give him reward for affliction and will give him something better than it in exchange. <em>(Muslim)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, know that you are not alone &#8211; everyone has their sad stories. Avoid comparing yourself to others in a seemingly better position &#8211; comparison leads to envy; maybe now things are peaches and cream for everyone else but this won&#8217;t always be the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only would it be unwise to risk your relationship with Allah (SWT) by being ungrateful for what you do have, but you&#8217;ll be transforming yourself from a victim (worthy of compensation from the Almighty) to a disgruntled sinner, whose heart is dark and compassion tainted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thirdly, change your perspective. See this as an opportunity to focus on other aspects of your life which you may have been neglecting; you have no idea how strong a boost this breakup may give your career, for example, simply because you&#8217;ll have more focus and energy to give to it. Also, by cultivating support from the other people in your life, you&#8217;ll in fact be strengthening your relationship with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourthly, keep yourself busy with a lot of dhikr, charity work and reading: the distraction you&#8217;ll need will depend on your type of personality. If you&#8217;re an energetic extrovert then you need the physical and social aspect of giving back to the community. When you find yourself absolutely incapable of finding happiness, try to provide it to others who may need it &#8211; you&#8217;ll find comfort in calming their pain and solace in drawing peace to their hearts, even if momentarily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, He (SWT) who has lead you to this storm will lead you through it; do not place too much reliance on His creation when you have the Creator by your side. Let Him be your beacon of light and wisdom and be certain that He (SWT) will not let you down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Umm Suhayb shares her gardening journey and some of the benefits it can bring along the way.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always liked to be out in nature and in the garden, to grow things and to feel full of fresh air as I scrub the dirt out of my nails after a session in the garden. It started as a child, having a little patch in my parent’s garden. I would pop radish seeds into the ground and be amazed at how they turned into pink and white balls that my dad would enthusiastically eat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Bringing it to another level</strong></span><br />
Time passed and changes in my accommodation meant that cultivation was restricted to a few pots of herbs, some cress, or maybe some tomatoes on the balcony. Then, a year ago, I realised it could be worth putting my name down on the allotment list, and within a few months I was offered one. Allotments are available here in Sweden and in other countries and are small plots of land for rent on which you can grow flowers, fruits and vegetables. The amount of land on the allotment is much more substantial than my balcony, and so began my journey into mini-farmhood, much to the bemusement of my husband. To want to get your hands covered in soil, dig out weeds and walk endlessly around with a watering can may seem mad to some. But once you try it, you can become hooked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Nourishment for the soul</strong></span><br />
So to add to this, I was really pleased one day to come across this hadith as I was flicking through one of my children’s colouring books:</p>
<p>‘When a man plants a tree or cultivates a farm which provides food for birds, men and animals, the eating of it will be counted as charity for him.’ <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Ahmed, At-Tirmidhi)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see a barren patch of soil change to a crop full of vegetables that you can actually eat and not have to buy from the supermarket feels amazing. To think a tiny seed can become something as huge as a pumpkin is a miracle, which can only increase your iman and humbleness in front of Allah (SWT). Surah Ar-Rahman springs to mind: ‘Then which of the favours of your Lord will you deny?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not alone in seeing the benefits of gardening. The allotment scene was once the domain of retired men, but now you are just as likely to see families, students and Muslim women digging a trench or harvesting potatoes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Find your inner-snail!</strong></span><br />
But it is not just the results of the harvest that are beneficial, but also the process of creating a little green space. There is a ‘Rehab-garden’ in Alnarp in Sweden where I live, which mostly takes women who are suffering from ‘burn-out syndrome’. Many of these women have been carrying out a role similar to men, having a full-time career and being a bread-winner, but are still also expected to take care of everyone else’s needs. It’s something I’m sure many can relate to, and unsurprisingly, it can all get too much and affect your health. A therapist working with patients in the garden expressed ‘The garden’s part in the treatment is powerful.’ It brings an environment without stress, and instead forms a calm, safe bubble. They work with sensory-stimulation – sight, hearing, taste and smell – as they say people have often lost contact between the mind and body. One patient remarked ‘I’ve learnt time for my own relaxation is as important as anything else’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Burn those calories</strong></span><br />
For those of you, like me, who are not particularly sporty, gardening is good form of gentle exercise. The vegetables you may be growing will be giving you a good source of nutrition, and the energy expended in doing so will help burn off  any unwanted calories you might have nibbled from those less healthy foods in your cupboards!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Do what suits you best</strong></span><br />
For me, having a small farm that provides enough food for me and my family would be ideal &#8211; but for now, not possible. Alhamdulillah, I have my patch that I can call my own, where I can forget the domestic hustle and bustle for a couple of hours, I can give my body a mini-workout and give my iman a boost. Whatever you can manage, be it an orchid on the windowsill or some herbs on your balcony, it can only be life-enriching.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Iimaan Shayma looks at what we know of the soul and how nurturing it can improve the quality of this life and the next. 
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was once resting on a palm branch when a group of Jews walking by asked him about the soul. The Prophet (SAW) stayed silent, an indication to his companions that he was receiving revelation. They waited patiently for the Prophet (SAW) to relay the message <em>(Bukhari)</em>. The translation of the ayah revealed is:<br />
<em><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>“‘And they ask you [O Muhammad] concerning the rooh [the spirit or the soul]. Say: ‘The rooh: it is one of the things the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little.’”</strong> </span>(Al-Isra:85)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would explain why, for centuries, philosophers have failed to find answers to their questions about the soul. In Plato&#8217;s &#8216;Republic&#8217;, written around 380 BC, Socrates presents the theory of the Tripartite Soul, which is the idea that the soul consists of three competing elements: reason (rationality), spirit (courage, determination, bravery and inspiration) and appetite (physical desires, such as those of a sexual nature and the need to eat and drink). Plato&#8217;s theories, we know, are incorrect and we should be grateful they are! For Plato had a very exclusive understanding of who could achieve his version of true success. His theory was that only the Guardian class (the rulers of society) could attain a healthy, happy and balanced soul, one that allowed reason to govern over its desires and spirit. Everybody else in society was doomed to an inescapable life of misery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite Allah (SWT) giving us limited knowledge of the soul, it would be wrong to say that we have absolutely none, as Allah does in fact provide us with some insight. We know the soul is immortal and that the Angel of Death extracts it from our body at the time of death. We also know that our immortal souls will be questioned and entered into Paradise or Hellfire. In &#8216;Mysteries of the Soul Expounded&#8217; Abu Bilal Mustafa al-Kanadi writes:<br />
“&#8230;man consists of a spirit and a body together. The spirit [soul or rooh] is an entity which differs from the physical, tangible body. It is a higher type of luminous (or light-like) being, alive and moving, and it penetrates the limbs, circulating through them as water circulates throughout the petals of a rose, as oil circulates throughout the olive and as fire circulates throughout the burning embers of coal.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintaining a pure and happy soul is integral to leading a good and happy life that will lead you to Jannah insha Allah. There are whole books dedicated to teaching you how to do this, such as &#8216;Purification of the Soul&#8217;. Our soul is an entity that is separate from our body and yet the body is governed by it. So ensuring that we have a healthy soul has a huge effect on our spiritual and even physical being; a healthy soul enables us to lead a happy and satisfying life and one that will benefit us both in this life and the Hereafter insha Allah. In my opinion, there are many ways we can achieve this, but here are my top three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>1. Worshipping Allah</strong></span><br />
In Surah Adh-Dhariyat, Allah says: <em><strong><span style="color: #339966;">“And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</span></strong></em> <em>(Adh-Dhariyat:56)</em><br />
This has profound implications on a huge array of matters, from the meaning of life to the fact that we can begin to question the benefit of every single action we do on a day-to-day basis. This ayah suggests that anything we do that creates an outcome that does not include the worship of Allah is merely a distraction. Our souls are inclined to worshipping our Creator, but our environment, our actions, our engagements and our behaviour is what distracts or prevents the soul from being in its natural and happiest state. Some may be surprised by the prospect of dedicating everything we do to the worship of Allah. There&#8217;s no need to be. Islam is easy and, with merely altering your intention, you can turn everything into ‘ibadah (worship). You can turn what seems to be a mundane, daily task into worship just by taking a second to dedicate that undertaking to pleasing Allah, whether it is cleaning your home, taking your mother shopping, cooking for your husband or giving salam to your neighbour. Begin eating with the words &#8216;bismillah&#8217; and even dinner becomes an opportunity for dhikr.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are constantly remembering Allah you have fed your soul the nourishment it craves and so you will see barakah enter and fill your life. Not only is this positive for your life beyond death, but it also allows you to be free from the limitations we mistakenly place on our ability to worship Allah. Establishing this purpose will insha Allah leave you feeling content and inspired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>2. Abstain from Sinning</strong></span><br />
Of course if it was this simple, everyone would do it. But my point is that we should make it a priority to stay away from even those sins that we&#8217;ve begun to take for granted. Being desensitised to even the smallest of sins is not a habit we want to develop, for the accumulation of minor sins can lead a person to Jahannam just as surely as major sins. Our souls yearn to be pure and we often forget that sinning has a direct impact on the state of our lives. A person who lives a life of sin, Muslim or non-Muslim, will never achieve true happiness. When you aim to please Allah by practising patience in restraint (from the haram) and by striving in the halal, your soul has established the struggle it was designed to undertake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"> <strong>3. Practice Gratitude</strong></span><br />
Ibn Taymiyyah has said: “Indeed there is a Paradise in this world; whoever does not enter it will not enter the Paradise of the Hereafter.”<br />
For the longest time, I couldn&#8217;t understand what he was trying to say. And then one day, in the midst of a very difficult situation that forced me to appreciate all the blessings I was taking for granted, I suddenly experienced a lightbulb moment. My understanding of this is that the believer should expect to undergo trials and tribulations. In fact, the best among our predecessors, including the Prophet (SAW), experienced pain and hardship so extreme that it left some of the companions asking: <span style="color: #339966;"><em><strong>“When will the help of Allah [come]?”</strong></em></span><br />
<em><span style="color: #339966;"><strong> Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said,&#8221;When is the help of Allah ?&#8221; Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near.</strong> </span>(Al-Baqarah: 214) </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ibn Taymiyyah is highlighting the importance of gratitude in all circumstances. The person who is in a situation that leaves them with no choice but to practice shukr will of course gain reward, but the person who does have the choice and who strives to practise gratitude over ingratitude will be rewarded more <em>(Ibn Qayyim)</em>. Learning how to be grateful is a skill and it is one that requires nurture, time and effort. But the person who masters it lives in a Paradise that they carry around in their heart on Earth, because it leads to a peace, contentment and happiness that the ungrateful, restless soul craves. Teaching our soul to be content in the most difficult circumstances is an achievement that will reflect positively for both your physical being and your state of mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leading a happy and healthy life is not something that is exclusively available to people who are blessed with a life of ease. Everybody has the potential and ability to acquire happiness, despite the circumstances they find themselves in. Practising ‘ibadah, repentance and gratitude can provide us with the tools we need to establish a healthy soul and, in turn, a healthy and happy life. The key lies in training our soul to love Allah and His deen. When we establish this and it evidently permeates throughout our life, the Most Just will reward us by placing us on a path that will lead to Jannah, insha Allah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[From a pregnancy pause to menopause - the changes in a woman’s body during this period are as
dynamic as they are vast. Dr. Aye]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong><span style="color: #e84a99;">1. Know your breast:</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong> Mammograms and screening</strong><br />
Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women who do not smoke. The risk of developing breast cancer can be decreased by:<br />
• Regular exercise<br />
• Maintaining a healthy weight<br />
• Avoiding alcohol<br />
• Carefully considering the benefits and risks of Hormone Replacement Therapy<br />
The UK NHS Breast Screening Programme (i.e. mammography) has been shown to reduce mortality (likelihood of death) from breast cancer*. These results correlate with studies from other countries. Screening allows cancer to be detected earlier, leading to earlier and possibly less radical treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>What is mammography?</strong></em><br />
It is a type of low energy X-Ray used to detect abnormalities in breast tissue such as masses and microcalcifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>When should I do a mammogram and how often should it be done?</strong></em><br />
Each country has its own protocol for breast cancer screening and the age at which mammography should be performed.<br />
• In the UK, the NHS cancer screening programme invites women between ages 50 and 70 for screening every three years. They have started extending their programme to women in their late forties and up to 73 years.<br />
• According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, “Most women should have their first mammogram at age 50 and then have another mammogram every two years until age 74.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Know your breast</strong><br />
A breast self examination is when you check your own breasts for lumps, changes in size or shape of the breast, or any other changes in the breasts or underarm ** . This can be done regularly to know your breast in terms of the regular tissue composition and feel so that you can be more attuned to any abnormality. Although it has not been found to decrease the risk of mortality from breast cancer, it is important as it can assist with early detection of breast concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #e84a99;"><strong>2. Circumvent cervical cancer:</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>Pap smears</strong><br />
After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35. The majority of cervical cancer cases are thought to be caused by HPV (Human Papilloma Virus). Cervical cancer can be prevented by:<br />
• Practicing safe sex with a single partner as the virus which is thought to cause cervical cancer is sexually transmitted<br />
• Cervical screening<br />
• HPV vaccination &#8211; available in some countries<br />
• Quitting smoking</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>What is the screening test for cervical cancer </em></strong><strong><em>and how is this performed?</em></strong><br />
A pap smear is the screening test of choice whereby a doctor or nurse inserts an instrument called a speculum to widen the vagina. Cells and mucus from the cervix are collected and sent for laboratory investigations to detect abnormal cells in the cervix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>At what age should I get a pap smear </em></strong><strong><em>performed and how often does it need to be </em></strong><strong><em>done?</em></strong><br />
The NHS recommendation (UK) invites women aged 25-49 for screening every three years, and women aged 50-64 are invited every five years. The CDC recommends getting “regular Pap tests at age 21, or within three years of the first time you have sex &#8211; whichever happens first.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #e84a99;">3. Delight in sunlight and </span><span style="color: #e84a99;">consume calcium</span></h3>
<p>Osteoporosis is a disease of low bone mass and bone deterioration which puts a woman at an increased risk for developing fractures. Bone disease often occurs later in life but beginning prevention at a very young age and continuing with these measures throughout adulthood is very important. Strong dense bones require adequate calcium, Vitamin D and sufficient weight bearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Weight Bearing Exercise</strong><br />
These exercises allow muscles and bones to work against gravity allowing for bone strengthening. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, adults need to engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most (but preferably all) days of the week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br />
<strong><em> Why:</em></strong><br />
• A deficiency here leads to a deficiency in bone mineralisation, eventually leading to osteoporosis.<br />
• It is important for cell growth, immune function, reducinginflammation and neuromuscular function.<br />
• It helps your body to absorb calcium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em> Getting enough:</em></strong><br />
• Found in milk, eggs and oily fish.<br />
• Get enough sunlight as most vitamin D intake is made in the skin through sunlight exposure.<br />
[If you are at risk of not receiving enough vitamin D, consult with your doctor about taking Vitamin D supplements.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Calcium</strong><br />
<strong><em>Why</em></strong><br />
It is a building block for bones; strong bones mean enough calcium!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em> Getting enough</em></strong><br />
It is absorbed from food and can be found in the following foods:<br />
nuts, dairy products, dark leafy vegetables and calcium fortified foods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #e84a99;">4. Folate and ferrous for the </span><span style="color: #e84a99;">foetus</span></h3>
<p>A healthy pregnancy yields happy, healthy babies and mums. In readying your body for pregnancy, Dr. Ameera Adam ((Obstetrics and Gynaecology registrar from Cape Town, South Africa) recommends that mums-to-be take folate and iron supplements (ferrous sulphate). Folic acid supplements at the time of conception and in the first trimester reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the baby. Women who are on chronic medication should consult their doctor about whether these drugs will affect foetal development &#8211; they may need to be changed or substituted. According to Dr. Adam, “Physiologically, the best age to fallpregnant is around 25 years of age.” She maintains that women wishing to conceive should abstain from smoking and drinking and optimise their health status by exercise and healthy eating.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Instructor Khadija Safari gets you roaring and ready to fight!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would you be surprised if I told you that I love my job? In fact, I love it so much that in my spare time I hang out at my dojo for fun! I am always thinking about my job and about ways of being able to do it more often, offer it to more sisters and often I am asked if I can teach sisters to do what I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a revert I was searching desperately for somewhere to train and keep fit, to the point where I really didn’t mind what sport it was as long as I could find something. I couldn’t believe that so little was on offer for Muslim women. And here began my journey into setting up the Safari Muay Thai camp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b80404;"><strong>What is Muay Thai?</strong></span><br />
Muay Thai is  an ancient martial art that is believed to have stemmed in the pre 1200’s in Thailand. It was developed to help defend against perpetual invasions from neighbouring countries, when the only weapons available were short range weapons, such as spears, pikes and clubs. Instead of pads (like we use now), they would train by kicking banana trees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muay Thai uses eight limbs of the body: fists, elbows, knees and shins. Boxing gloves were only brought into Muay Thai in the late 1920’s. The lighter version, commonly known as kickboxing, was adapted in America, and removes the use of elbows, knees, clenches and low kicks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muay Thai is for anyone wanting to get ultra fit, stay in shape, tone up and learn how to defend themselves. It’s fast, technical and super effective. It provides the best work out of any sport and it’s suitable for all levels of fitness. Muay Thai provides a high impact, calorie-burning session that will leave you fully charged with positive energy. Most sisters training have given up their gym memberships to opt for Muay Thai as their choice for fitness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b80404;"><strong>Bringing women together</strong></span><br />
Shattering the presumption that Muslim women are oppressed, controlled by their husbands and sit at home all day cooking and cleaning, one hour inside our Safari’s Strictly Ladies Muay Thai class demonstrates this is not the case at all! Sisters come to my sessions for many reasons, primarily for fitness and weight loss, but the variety of women is an eye opener as to how much our society needs this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our classes we often have sisters who are battling with a severe lack of confidence, or are victims of domestic violence, or are victims of gun/knife/racial attacks. We have sisters who are lawyers, doctors and bankers. We have sisters who are desperately looking for a way to relieve stress, depression, infertility as well as other health issues such as diabetes, high blood pressure and sickle cell. We have niqabis who are looking to defend themselves from being attacked. I had not realised the level of attacks on niqabi sisters until I saw a steady flow of them telling me how they had faced attacks just walking down the street. This one martial art has brought all of these ladies together!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just last week we held a charity Fight Night, where sisters got a feel of what it’s like to have your own corner, with just one minute water breaks between rounds. If you saw these sisters in the mosque, you would never think for a minute that they are capable of throwing almighty blows like that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b80404;"><strong>Class Breakdown</strong></span><br />
All classes start with a three-minute warm up, either skipping or jogging with weights. A paired circuit is kept ready, consisting of squats with weights, press-ups, stomach crunches, explosive jumps, back dips and much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since pairing partners offers encouragement, sisters are put into pairs to begin the “cardio killer” circuit. With just two minutes on each station and a 30 second break between each point – we get moving. I haven’t named it the ‘cardio killer’ for nothing! You would think that sisters would try to skip this class, but burning calories is so high on their wish list that the idea of aching muscles the next day is more than tempting. The circuit continues for 45 minutes, when the class finally receives their first two minutes of a break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now sisters grab their boxing gloves and making sure their hand wraps and ankle supports are on, we head for the dojo to get on with the part they’ve been waiting for: Muay Thai training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I begin by demonstrating the technique that I’d like them to work on. One person wears a pair of pads to receive the attack and the other wears her gloves, ready to attack. Fifteen minutes in, I extend the technique to complete it with a final take down; a great example of how the moves learnt could be used in a self-defence situation. Questions are asked, techniques get tested and I make sure I see a clear sweat breaking from each mirror in the room. The steam on the windows symbolises to me that it’s time to swap partners so that one half of the class can get a break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With crucial techniques in place, I now demonstrate the use of speed, combining punches and kicks, building up in number. One punch, one kick, two punches, two kicks, three punches, three kicks and so on up to ten. This really works on increasing stamina levels; the more speed used, the more calories burnt, and when repeated every week the results are unbelievable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven’t exercised since you were last forced to at school, or know that your fitness level isn’t what it should be, that doesn’t mean that Muay Thai isn’t for you. The great thing about it is, no matter what is being asked of you, you are able to take it at your own pace. Eight week beginner courses are always a favourite for sisters wanting to try something new, and breaks them in gently, allowing them to learn all of the core techniques, improving fitness levels, targeting problem areas and improving confidence. This prepares them to not only be able to train more often, but also to have the opportunity to take part in grading, the process used to achieve belts. With eight belts in total until black belt, I haven’t met one sister who isn’t aiming high. This also comes with the opportunity to be able to go on to teach these skills to other sisters, the youth and children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is more rewarding is knowing that it is a Sunnah for us to know how to defend ourselves, keep fit, healthy and to unite our community together. At the same time, this has also allowed non-Muslim ladies an insight into Muslim women, as we all train together. Getting fit, getting rewards and breaking down stereotypes – all in one class!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chance of being so unfit that you can’t join in is slim, and so is the chance that you’ll be too fit that you won’t break a sweat! What’s stopping you? Sign up for a Muay Thai class in your area now!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I don’t want to struggle with kids. I don’t want to be on my own,” Maryam finally whispered out loud, as her sister watched the tears silently make way down her cheek.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You won’t be on your own,” her sister reassured. “You have us and Allah will not place you in this situation and leave you to your own devices.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“But this is not what I want. I don’t want this situation.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Nobody chooses their test. You didn’t ask to be abandoned with kids in tow. Nobody gets married knowing what the future will hold.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maryam hesitated. “But what if I am destined to be on my own? I can’t change what has already been decreed. That’s what’s so terrifying. What if I am destined to be on my own?” Maryam said with finality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If this is what Allah has decreed for you, then you have little choice but to go through it. Your situation is enfolding as we speak. If this is what Allah is testing you with, then you face it with complete trust in him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maryam sighed, “Can I do it? Can I just completely put my trust in Allah and not wonder what will become of me?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You have to. You don’t have a choice, just the way Hajar, the wife of Ibrahim <em>alayhisalam</em> didn’t when she was left alone without clarity in her future.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The month of sacrifice has come and gone— the days of Hajj, the days of historical rituals are over. We followed the footsteps of Hajar (RA) and Ibrahim (AS) to commemorate possibly the biggest challenge in their lives: accepting an unwanted situation for the sake of Allah (SWT). Who would want to be left alone in the desert with an infant son? Who would want to willingly sacrifice their only child, without even knowing why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unknown is scary. An uncertain future is a terrifying prospect to acknowledge, especially when you can’t see possible positive outcomes, nor even second guess what might happen. We take security and certainty for granted, routinely planning what is going to happen day to day. We think we have security but what happens when it is pulled out from beneath us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn’t this exactly what happened to Hajar (RA)? The world was pulled from beneath her when she was lead out to the desert with her baby son Ismail (AS) and left there with no explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Abraham walked through cultivated land, desert, and mountains until he reached the desert of the Arabian Peninsula and came to an uncultivated valley having no fruit, no trees, no food, no water. The valley had no sign of life. After Abraham had helped his wife and child to dismount, he left them with a small amount of food and water which was hardly enough for two days. He turned around and walked away. His wife hurried after him asking: ‘Where are you going Abraham, leaving us in this barren valley?’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abraham did not answer her, but continued walking. She repeated what she had said, but he remained silent. Finally she understood that he was not acting on his own initiative. She realized that Allah had commanded him to do this. She asked him: ‘Did Allah command you to do so?’ He replied: ‘Yes.’ Then his great wife said: ‘We are not going to be lost, since Allah Who has commanded you is with us.&#8221; (From <i>Stories of the Prophets </i>by Ibn Kathir)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Didn’t Hajar face the same panic and fear of the unknown? Didn’t Hajar (RA) have a right to question why?  Of course she did! Hajar (RA) faced numerous possibilities. She had to accept that she may never see her husband again, accept that her son may die, accept that she may die first, and her baby son would be left alone. They were all terrifying situations to contemplate. But look at the response of Hajar (RA): &#8220;We are not going to be lost, since Allah Who has commanded you is with us.” It is such a simple and strong formula to abide by; we listen, we obey, and we do not doubt the help of Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the formula we need to adapt in our lives. It is a belief we need to live by to give ourselves peace of mind and security. There are certain stations we cannot achieve with our faith and good deeds alone -to become a more beloved servant of Allah (SWT)- and so we are placed in situations that require great sacrifice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not that we are expected to willingly give up our beloved children, nor are we are expected to be led out into the desert and left to fend for ourselves, but  a sacrifice requires such a state of mind where we are ready to give something up, even when we  no idea what the outcome will be. It doesn’t have to be huge sacrifices, it could be just a little of our time, or a little more of our heart or giving up something we love for the greater good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus we are presented with such situations that require exactly what was required of Hajar (RA) and Ibrahim (AS): a leap of faith. This can be such daunting test in our life, where we have no choice but to take a deep breath and just leap into the unknown. This is <i>tawakkul</i>. <i>Tawakkul</i> is complete trust and sole reliance upon Allah (SWT). It is ingraining the words of the supplication we make every day in our <i>salah</i>:</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>“You alone we worship and you alone we ask for help.”</strong> </span>(Al-Fatiha :4)  </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>“And whoever places his trust in Allah, Sufficient is He for him, for Allah will surely accomplish His Purpose: For verily, Allah has appointed for all things a due proportion.”</strong> </span>(At-Talaq :3)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>“…and put your trust in Allâh if you are believers indeed.”</strong> </span>(Al-Maidah :23)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation could be anything &#8211; divorce, death, illness, moving continents, or even getting married. It could be revealing truths, or concealing truths knowing that the consequences could be dire. It could be going away for the sake of Allah (SWT), leaving loved ones and dependants behind. Any situation requiring giving up something that is beloved to us is a type of sacrifice. Giving up peace of mind and security is a huge sacrifice, and all of the contexts above require trust in Allah’s (SWT) plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worry and anxiety will be inevitable, as it is human nature, but we take whatever practical steps we can within our capacity and then place complete trust in Allah’s (SWT) plan. <i>Tawakkul</i> doesn’t, mean that we should be complacent in our actions and just say “It is the Will of Allah (SWT) and there’s nothing I can do.” There are always things we can do to make our lives easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We only have to consider how Hajar (RA) actively searched for food and water, even though it was very apparent that there was no sign of life. Hajar did not give hope and strove with the belief that there would indeed be a solution, it was just a matter of when and how. Sometimes we are simply waiting for change when we are faced with hardships, but we should not become complacent. Live by this Hadith:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tie your camel first, then put your trust in Allah.&#8221; <em>(At-Tirmidhi, 2517)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, like Maryam, you face hardship through separation, death or divorce, then accept Allah’s (SWT) decree, but do not allow the situation to overwhelm you. Take each day and moment as it comes. Enlist as much practical support as you can. If possible, move to a place where you will have a support network. Discuss your financial matters with trusted people and seek financial assistance where possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even Ibrahim (AS), although acting upon orders, was still worried for his family that he was leaving behind, so he did whatever he could to try and ease the difficulty. He made the following supplication:</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>&#8220;O Our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley with no cultivation, by Your Sacred House (the Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca); in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayers perfectly (Iqamat as salat) so fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and O Allah provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks. O our Lord! Certainly, You know what we conceal and what we reveal. Nothing on the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah.&#8221;</strong> </span>(Ibrahim :37-38)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise we can use the above supplication, amongst others, when we see an obscure bleak future. Supplicate with the best supplications and ask for comfort and all the blessings that Allah (SWT) can grant. Call upon Allah (SWT) with all his beautifully revealed names to ask from His bounties and to ease our hardship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do everything within your capacity to make life easier for yourself, including embracing Allah’s (SWT) will and seeing things from a positive angle. Ask yourself if this situation hadn’t arisen would you have been any happier? What do you think your life would have been like, five years on, had it remained the same? Would you have been a stronger or weaker Muslim? As ultimately, all of our problems have been placed to test our faith. It is a test of how accepting we are of what Allah (SWT) has decreed for us. On the flip side, our intellect/common sense and <i>Tawakkulis</i> a safety net for us. We are not weak, nor intellectually deficient, nor incapable &#8211; we would not have been placed in such a situation if we were any of those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always remember that Allah (SWT) does not burden a soul beyond his capacity and the promise of Allah when he says: <em><strong><span style="color: #993366;">“Verily, with every hardship there is ease.”</span> </strong>(Ash-Sharh :5-6)</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Often we can get caught up in the obligation of wudhu. J. Samia Mair shares how she brought some of the tranquility back into her ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every time I plopped my right foot into the sink of a public restroom, I felt anxiety, waiting for a non-Muslim to enter who would completely misunderstand what I am doing. Even just washing my arms above my elbows or wiping my hair and ears in a public restroom used to make me feel stressed, worried that someone would think I had OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) or that I was homeless and illegally ‘bathing’ in the restroom. But making wudhu in a public restroom was not my only problem. Even in my home or in another Muslim’s home or in another Islam-friendly place, my wudhu did not seem like an act of worship in itself, but something I needed to get through quickly in order to perform my salah. Over the years, I have tried different ways to make performing wudhu more spiritual, whether I am at home or travelling. I think I have finally figured it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we all know, wudhu is <em>fardh</em> (obligatory) for prayer, unless one is in major impurity and needs <em>ghusl</em> or if there is no water to be found and <em>tayammum</em> (dry ablution) is permitted. Prayer, of course, is incumbent upon adult, sane Muslims five times a day, unless one is excused such as a menstruating woman. In fact, our tradition reports that wudhu is the key to prayer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiya reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “The key to the prayer is the performance of ablution; the opening of the prayer is the exaltation of Allah (takbeer) and the closing of the prayer is the invocation of peace (tasleem).” <em>(Ibn Majah)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous other ahadith mention additional benefits of wudhu, both in this world and the next, including wiping away sins, elevating our status and allowing our beloved Messenger (SAW) to recognise us on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of wudhu cannot be overstated, and it is an act of worship in itself. It must be done carefully and with the right intention. Indeed, when some of the companions were washing their feet hastily in wudhu, the Prophet (SAW) told them in a loud voice two or three times, “Save your heels from the Hellfire!” <em>(Bukhari and Muslim)</em> Yet, many of us rush through wudhu, barely giving it any thought, whether we are at home or elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b00485;"><strong>5 Steps to Performing Wudhu Well</strong></span><br />
Performing wudhu well, and by this I mean doing it slowly and correctly and feeling that it is an act of worship in itself, works best for me when I do five things:<br />
1. leave the bathroom;<br />
2. sit down facing the Qibla;<br />
3. conserve water;<br />
4. slow down; and<br />
5. invest in items that are beautiful and designated specifically for wudhu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, at all costs I try to avoid doing wudhu in a bathroom. It always seemed unsanitary to me because, after all, it’s a bathroom. It’s hard to feel spiritual in a place where Allah’s (SWT) name shouldn’t even be mentioned. At home, I make wudhu where I perform salah, which helps me to start putting Dunya matters aside. Second, I sit down on a small stool and face the Qibla as I would in salah. This further helps me to take my mind from the Dunya as I position myself towards Allah’s (SWT) house. Third, even running a trickle of water in the sink made me feel like I was doing wrong, knowing that the Prophet (SAW) warned us about being wasteful when performing wudhu:</p>
<p>Abdullah ibn Amr reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, passed by Sa’d while he was performing ablution. The Prophet said, “What is this extravagance?” Sa’d said, “Is there extravagance with water in ablution?” The Prophet said, “Yes, even if you were on the banks of a flowing river.”<em> (ibn Majah)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to limit the amount of water I use during wudhu, I have a cup of water and a bowl to catch the water, which I place on a thin Turkish Pestemal cotton towel I put in front of my stool to catch any dripping water. The Prophet (SAW) is reported in many ahadith to have performed wudhu with one ‘mudd’ of water. A ‘mudd’ has been defined as “equivalent to the volume of two hands of an average man cupped together so that they are neither flat nor clasped shut”, while others sources mention that wudhu should be made with 0.51 litres or 0.75 litres of water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purposely try to slow myself down while performing wudhu. Slowing down is much easier, and indeed natural, when you are sitting down with a cup of water to use rather than when you are standing in front of a sink, doing wudhu quickly so that you won’t waste too much water dripping from the tap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Finally, I chose my cup, my bowl, my stool and the thin towel to catch any dripping water with great care to be soothing and aesthetically pleasing. These items are designated solely for wudhu, which honours them and reminds me that what I am doing is a beautiful act of worship. One might think that all of these steps add a great deal of time to performing wudhu, but they don’t. My wudhu equipment is stored together and easily accessible. Doing wudhu with this extra care only adds minutes to a rushed wudhu done quickly in the bathroom while standing in front of the sink. Wudhu in this way helps me to travel from the Dunya to the Akhirah as I prepare for salah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also keep a micro stool (weighing only 284 g), a collapsible camping bowl and cup, and a thin Turkish hand cloth in my bag to perform wudhu as I do at home when I am at a friend’s house or in another environment with sufficient privacy. Unfortunately, though, there are times when I have to do my wudhu in a restroom, such as when I am physically travelling. I have found that using a wudhu cup to avoid wasting water and doing wudhu slowly puts me in a better place spiritually even if I am not sitting in a place of salah and facing the Qibla.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alhamdulillah, I no longer am concerned about what others might think when I make wudhu in public, and I believe much of that is because wudhu means so much more to me now than it used to. May Allah I accept our intentions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  importance  of a wudhu cannot be overstated, and it is an act of  worship in itself. It must be done  carefully  and with the right intention.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a controlled freefall, I glide and curve my way over the surface of the mountain, barely touching the ground at times. On the open slopes, with the wind under my outspread arms, I feel like an eagle soaring over the world. Dodging branches and hopping over snow-covered logs in the sleeping forest, I feel like some primeval hunter chasing her prey. Off the beaten paths, I know where to find fresh powder &#8211; sometimes two or three feet deep &#8211; so light and fluffy that I cannot see my feet beneath me, and I am suddenly in heaven, floating through a cloud. All around me is silence and pure, sparkling white. I am as alive as I can possibly be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is no surprise that skiing and snowboarding are gaining popularity all over the world and have mushroomed into multi-billion dollar industries and professional sports. They are not merely sports or hobbies, but activities that bring us back to nature and enliven the spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
They can also be an excellent way to worship Allah (SWT). You don’t need to be double-black-diamond to lay back on the snow, gaze out at the horizon and be humbled by the overwhelming presence of Allah (SWT). I personally find in it a feeling of absolute, unparalleled freedom that I have found nowhere else.  It can be empowering, as well. As you gradually gain mastery over your legs and begin to feel at ease on the slopes, you feel the joy of hard-earned success that can inspire you to succeed in other parts of your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Skiing and Snowboarding are the perfect sport for Muslim women. They are especially great for conscientious sisters, as one needn’t worry about sticking out or seeing haram everywhere you look. Unlike many sports, conforming to the tenents of hijab are the norm rather than the exception. Because of the cold, everyone is covered from head to toe, and the trousers are thick and baggy.  Even a niqabi can feel at ease on the slopes with a nice, cozy neck gaiter pulled over her nose!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Winter doesn’t need to be boring for kids &#8211; get them on the slopes! Enrolling them in ski lessons will give them a chance to make friends, get some exercise, experience the natural world and make many happy memories. It also makes a perfect family day out or weekend together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Skiing and Snowboarding as exercise</strong></span><br />
Skiing and snowboarding are an excellent way to stay in shape.  Every day I go snowboarding, I return home with that pleasurable ache in my bones, the sign of a day well-spent. Skiing can improve your coordination, tone and strengthen muscles of the legs, thighs and back and build stamina. It also keeps your heart rate moderately elevated for 15-30 minute runs with rests in between as you ride up the lifts, which is the perfect cardiovascular workout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>How to get started</strong></span><br />
One thing that can be off-putting to potential skiers and riders is the sheer cost of clothing and equipment. The best thing to do is gradually upgrade as you grow and develop in the sport. Start by getting a decent set of snow trousers, jacket, gloves, helmet and goggles, which you can find used at very reasonable prices, but rent your board/skis and boots for the first few years. When you rent, you will have someone there to custom-fit your equipment for your body type and ability, which is a real blessing, especially if all skis and snowboards look the same to you. As the years progress, and if you decide you want to stick with it, you may want to consider investing in your own set of equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Safety first</strong></span><br />
You may be thinking that, as a beginner going a snail’s pace, what’s the worst that could happen? Believe me, bad things can happen. It is only by the mercy of Allah I that I am not paralysed from a spinal injury I received while snowboarding as a teenager. Beware of reckless skiers, wear a helmet at all times, know the limits of your ability and stay out of forbidden areas. These things are marked off for a reason; falling into a snow-covered stream, for example, will give you hypothermia faster than you can say “snow patrol”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said, do not be afraid of falling down. Rather, embrace it as an art. It is only by falling down that we learn to pick ourselves up and do it a little better next time, insha Allah. Everyone will fall in the beginning and come home with a few sore spots here and there, but don’t let it discourage you. Just like when you made those first wobbling steps, after weeks of trying and falling, you were suddenly unstoppable, toddling (and still falling) joyfully into the big, wide world. No matter what your age, you can get the hang of it with a little practice and dedication and, before you know it, you’ll be soaring like an eagle too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, for all the sisters who live not even remotely near any possibility of going skiing or snowboarding, I want to say that it is my most sincere wish that you may get to experience, some day, the joys of skiing; maybe on a family trip or study abroad or romantic mountain honeymoon. The mountains are beckoning you.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Life coach and natural nutritionist, Sayeda Habib reflects on reaping the fruits of winter.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winter is a wonderful time for rest and introspection. The shorter days are a signal that we ought to change our routine a little bit to adapt to the time of year. Winter brings lots of wonderful things with it, but it also brings the dreaded winter flu season for many.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know many people who get a cold or flu every winter, like clockwork. Once the cold comes, it tends to linger on for days and weeks without budging. Of course getting sick is no fun; so perhaps taking a few preventive measures may be advisable. The usual viruses and bacteria will be present, but if our immune system is working well, then we should be able to keep the flu at bay, or at least recover faster. So let’s look a few simple things that we can do to stay healthier this winter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Adapt your routine</strong></span><br />
The mind and body is one system that works together. Our emotions and state of mind impact our health, and stress and colds have a connection. Take a moment to notice the last time you had a cold, were you feeling stressed or overwhelmed about something? Did it all seem too much? This may seem to be a co-incidence but in coaching terms overwhelm and colds go together. Many people keep the same routine in winter as they do in the summer. The problem with this is that our bodies naturally slow down in the winter months. Our lymphatic system slows down and the longer nights affect our sleep cycle. Carrying on with the same routine puts the system under stress. Stress is known to weaken the immune system and then follows the lingering cold. One important step then is to adapt your routine in the winter months. End your day a little earlier, and eat your evening meal earlier on as well. Give yourself a chance to take some time out to rest, and reflect. Then you will be ready for action when spring emerges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Exercise</strong></span><br />
It sounds odd to talk about rest and exercise at the same time but they each play an important role in health. Exercise boosts the immune system because it helps neutralise the chemicals that are released during stress. Choose an exercise that will help you relax both physically and mentally. Light exercise that you enjoy is often more beneficial than stressful exertion. Practicing yoga or Tai Chi is wonderful for mind and body. Also some light walking or rebounding helps to keep the lymphatic system moving. The lymphatic system is an essential part of our detox system and physical movement helps to keep it moving smoothly, especially as it tends to thicken in the winter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Drink water</strong></span><br />
This could possibly be one of the most important things to boost the overall function of the body. We are mostly water, yet we often forget to replenish this essential resource. Water helps us to remove toxins from the body, as well as facilitate chemical reactions taking place in the body all the time. When we are dehydrated, our cells cannot function as they are meant to, therefore leading to a stress alert in the body. Over time, this can lead to overwhelm, anxiety as well as a range of other symptoms. One thing that we can begin to do very easily is drink more water. Drinking other liquids such as juices, tea, and coffee do not have the same effect. In fact, tea and coffee remove water from the body. Drink water that is at room or body temperature; 8 glasses a day is the average indicator. You can adjust it depending on how you feel. Please hydrate with room temperature water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Get some sun</strong></span><br />
Sunlight not only makes us feel more optimistic, but it is essential for many of our cellular functions. We need light to carry out many of the metabolic processes within the body, and this is where both sunlight and food come in. Staying positive in the winter can be a challenge due to the shorter days, so get out and about when you notice the sun. Take a few moments and sit outdoors. Notice that you will feel better in your spirits, which will of course help in staying healthier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Eat seasonal fruit and vegetables</strong></span><br />
We hear talk about fruit and vegetables all the time but why are they so important? Fresh fruit and vegetables play an important part in our immune system because they provide us with valuable vitamins and minerals. We obtain most of our vitamins and minerals from plant food sources. Some vitamins and minerals are antioxidants; vital substances that help keep our immune system healthy, allowing us to ward off any nasty infections. This winter, eat seasonal fruit and vegetables and enjoy the local produce where you live. Seasonal foods have properties that are appropriate for the body at that time of year. If we eat according to the season, the body can digest the food more easily as it is going with the flow. Make sure to add some raw nuts, seeds and fish to your diet. These provide essential fatty acids that are required for the body to carry out a range of functions. Also, if you do get a cold or flu, avoid the foods that form mucus in the body, such as dairy, grains, and red meat, till the cold subsides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Natural cures and supplements</strong></span><br />
Allah (SWT) has given us the cures we need in Nature. However, we sometimes are not able to get all that we need from the food we eat and that’s where supplementation can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people rely on Vitamin C during a cold as it plays an important part in strengthening our immune system. It is recommended to have a vitamin and mineral supplement throughout the year to keep our bodies functioning at their best. Vitamins and minerals work as a team, and they all serve a valuable purpose and need a balance. A comprehensive vitamin and mineral supplement can play an important role in boosting immunity, and overall health. Certain vitamins and minerals known for their antioxidant properties include vitamin A, C, and E, B vitamins, along with Zinc, Magnesium and Selenium to name a few. All supplements however, are not the same, so do invest in a product that you feel confident with. In addition to a good supplement, adding in grapefruit seed extract, which is available from health food stores, can really help to boost immunity and kill off unwanted bacteria. Supplements are an important part of our health regimen due to our modern lifestyles. However, they are not a replacement for a wholesome diet. If you are keen to keep yourself well, then paying attention to food is of the utmost importance as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping a balance of eating well, exercise and keeping a positive outlook is important. I hope that the tips will be useful to you and I invite you to try the ones that you feel will make the most difference to you. Insha’Allah we will all enjoy this winter and take the time out to be with friends and family. Lets use this time of year to take stock of what we achieved and what we would like the new year to bring insha’Allah.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“<em>Discover the Best in You</em> is the next best thing to having your own personal life coach” claims Sayeda Habib, a qualified and experienced life coach and the author of this book. I think I might speak for many when I admit that self-help books don’t appeal to me very much. This is may just be my ego coming into play, but it may also have its roots in the memory of someone recommending a self-help book that ‘changed their life’ by chanting “I am confident, I am confident, I am confident ” X number of times, first thing in the morning. Cue incredulous stare. I’m sure chanting, meditation and the like may work as therapy for some people, but I prefer to look into more practical solutions when facing challenges in life. I also don’t like people telling me what to do with my life as I feel they may not understand the emotional side of my predicament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why it was such a joy to pick up <em>Discover the Best in You</em> and find that life coaching is not about telling you what to do, it’s “a process of collaboration and partnership where the coach supports the client to realise their individual potential and produce the results they want to achieve in their personal and professional lives”. Coaching is essentially being “given the space to design your own solution about how to move forward”. In other words, coaching is about being encouraged to think independently about your life from a new perspective and empowering you to be able to find your own solutions to challenges you face every day. Sayeda is, effectively, teaching the reader life skills. This is what makes coaching distinct from counselling and other forms of therapy. <em>Discover the Best in You</em> is aimed at anyone who wants to improve their life for the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sayeda strongly believes in the concept of individuality: “there is just one person who thinks, feels, acts and experiences life like you”, hence the importance of learning the right skills to be able to deal with life’s challenges on your own. Although I would say that it is a reference book with chapters that can be read individually, Discover the Best in You is designed to be read as a progressive text, at least on the first read. The coaching begins with improving the self and then attempting to better your relationship with everything and everyone else. The book starts by asking the reader to re-evaluate their life vision and discusses the importance of planning and goal setting; it then moves on to improving self-esteem and discovering the reader’s true self. It is only after this that Sayeda discusses the subject of enhancing relationships with other people, reiterating the fact that a person is not in the best position to fulfil duties towards others until they are first able to fulfil duties towards themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What impressed me most about <em>Discover the Best in You</em> is how simple and pragmatic Sayeda’s approach to self-improvement is. The exercises and activities suggested by Sayeda throughout the book involve sitting down and writing answers to the questions she asks. I consider writing to be a very cathartic activity because it allows you to spill emotions and thoughts that you might not have dared speak out loud and, very often, you may surprise yourself with what you write. Sayeda suggests simple exercises to challenge the reader’s way of thinking; for example, to encourage the reader to reinterpret life events that won’t let them move on in life, she asks the reader to write down their interpretation of an event, sort the facts from feelings and then write three alternative possibilities before adopting a new interpretation of the event in order to help the reader move on. Another simple but effective exercise that reappears in different contexts is to make a habit of writing down everything that the reader feels grateful for each day or everything they felt they had achieved that day, in order to encourage positive thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading <em>Discover the Best in You</em>, I’ve realised that life coaching would be a very useful form of therapy for anyone, and it’s certainly a good option for Muslims as it respects a person’s lifestyle and aims to improve their life for the better, not change it. The fact that Sayeda weaves examples from the Qur’an and Hadith into the book to highlight her points, affirms the reality that life coaching is in fact a therapy that is perfect for Muslims as Islam encourages constant self-improvement and living the best life that you can by utilising everything that you’ve been blessed with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Discover the Best in You</em> is a must read for all Muslims, as everyone could do with improving their lives, no matter what stage in life they are at.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Rafeeah Laher urges you to ignore the beastly voices in your mind and focus on the beauty you have shining from the inside. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know that voice inside your head that often scolds you? The one that berates you whenever your appearance falls short of something or makes you wince every time you happen to see someone who looks more glamorous than you? Well, whether your self-esteem is still going strong, fading or has disappeared altogether, that beastly voice needs to be silenced &#8211; for good!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course we all like to say we’re “not shallow” and don’t judge appearances, but in truth most of us tend to be the most judgemental towards ourselves. If you can’t remember the last time you looked at yourself in the mirror and didn’t find a single thing to complain about, then it’s high time you did. Arming yourself with a healthy dose of self-esteem is more important than ever, especially in today’s challenging environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world of peer pressure and mass media messages, self-criticism and an obsession with outward appearance are beasts that have been let loose. We live in a culture that makes people feel they aren’t good enough, pretty enough or rich enough and unfortunately most of the time appearance is valued over character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beauty is a word that can be given unlimited definition yet we are surrounded by a stream of monotonous messages telling us what beauty is supposedly about. Society has raised us to pay attention to those messages, which gives a deep hit to our self-esteem. We’re bombarded so much by images of perfect-looking people and fabulous lifestyles that when we look at our own selves, we’re faced with our inner critics and a line of questioning about why we’re not good enough. People are often confused about what it means to have self-esteem and keep thinking that others would like them better if they looked better. We tell ourselves that attractiveness can only be had if we wear this or eat that, buy this and not that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self-esteem simply means loving and appreciating yourself for who you are, flaws and all, and having confidence in your abilities and worth. Allah (SWT) made us all beautiful in our own way and we should accept it and not try to change ourselves just to fit in with everyone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) says, <em><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>“&#8230;He has given you shape and made your shapes good (looking) and has provided you with good things.”</strong> </span><span style="color: #999999;">(Ghafir:64)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re made by Allah (SWT) to look the way we do and we’re all given different blessings, so why do we fight the battle of self-perfection at the expense of our self-confidence? It is also mentioned in another verse, “O man! What has deceived you about your Lord, the most generous? Who created you, proportioned you and balanced you?”<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Al-Infitar:6-7)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be thankful for what you have and respect yourself. Every time you look in the mirror, instead of listening to the beast inside your head, read the dua “O Allah, as You have made my appearance beautiful, make my character beautiful” (<em>Allahumma kama hassanta khalqi fa hassin khuluqi</em>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to learn to ‘see’ with the mind, heart and soul and not just the eyes because beauty transcends what is apparent. Recognising internal beauty is a great first step towards gaining a good self-image. Beauty isn’t only about weight or facial features or makeup, nor should it be based on factors such as the car you drive, the job you have or the house you live in, it’s more about life’s magnificence reflected in your own character and attitude because real beauty stems from the inside. If not that, then what makes us beautiful? Is our beauty really only skin deep?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building self-esteem includes making the effort to change by having the courage to look ourselves straight in the eye, appreciate what we see and then move on from there. The worse you feel about yourself, the less energy and motivation you have to do what it takes to turn your self-esteem around. Feelings of inadequacy and damaging thoughts make your self-esteem plummet as your brain locks in on negative thinking, but self-esteem improves by changing both your notions and behaviours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how can we cultivate confidence, learn to end this negative self-criticism and begin to talk to ourselves in a kinder way? Here are 10 ways to help boost your self-esteem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>1. Look good, feel good</strong></span><br />
A low self-esteem doesn’t mean that your appearance should be neglected. An-Nabi (SAW) said in a hadith, “Allah (SWT) is beautiful and He loves beauty.”<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Muslim)</em></span> When you care for your appearance, you project an outward image of confidence even if you don’t feel that way and, by making that little extra effort to look your best, you will start to feel better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>2. Read something inspirational</strong></span><br />
Read books and articles that uplift you and make you feel positive. Stay away from negative television programmes, web sites, advertising or anything that reinforces a poor self-image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>3. Acknowledge failures</strong></span><br />
See failures as a necessary part of growth and learning. Failures are evidence of effort and you always learn something from them. Also, avoid setting unrealistic expectations for yourself because you will just be disappointed and feel low again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>4. Be creative</strong></span><br />
Focus on your talents and passions. Creativity is a wonderful feel-good therapy and finding something that you’re good at makes you feel happy and confident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>5. Embrace healthy habits</strong></span><br />
In Islam, we are encouraged to look after ourselves and practice healthy eating, sleeping and exercise patterns. Look after your body which is an <em>amanah</em> entrusted to you by Allah (SWT). Being healthy also induces a positive mindset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>6. Don’t use a magnifying mirror (both in the literal and figurative sense)</strong></span><br />
If you don’t notice tiny imperfections, chances are others won’t notice them either so don’t scrutinise yourself and go looking for physical or character flaws that are invisible to the naked eye as you’ll just end up feeling insecure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>7. Don’t compare yourself to others</strong></span><br />
Competing and comparing with others is a fool’s game that no one ever wins because it’s a never-ending cycle. There will always be someone who is more sophisticated or better at something. Everyone is blessed in a different way but that’s what makes us unique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>8. Use hopeful statements</strong></span><br />
Treat yourself with kindness and encouragement, because we become what we tell ourselves. Remember that as believers we are encouraged to be optimistic and positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>9. Forgive yourself</strong></span><br />
Everyone makes mistakes and mistakes aren&#8217;t permanent reflections on you as a person. Tell yourself, &#8220;I made a mistake, but that doesn&#8217;t make me a bad person.” Find ways to fix your mistakes if you can but don’t be too hard on yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cf3a04;"><strong>10. Focus on the positive</strong></span><br />
Think about the good parts of your life. Remind yourself of things that have gone well recently. Consider the skills you&#8217;ve used to cope with challenging situations. Encompass your positive qualities. Make a list of things that make you feel good about yourself or keep an affirmation journal. Reminding yourself of all your assets is a sure confidence booster.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A childhood photograph prompts Jenna Evans to reflect on the complex and unpredictable journey we call life.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two baby girls lay side by side, arms intertwined, with their big brown eyes focused on the camera. Born only weeks apart at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the cousins spent much of their early months and years together. Nevertheless, a photograph taken when they were three months old is the only evidence that they started life in the same place, at the same time, linked by kinship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I envisage the photograph, I wonder if their family members knew just how different their lives would turn out to be, or whether they imagined that their little girls would grow up together, bound by sisterhood and shared experiences. Were they aware of the stark differences they would face at home and in their communities? Could they have foreseen the disparities in access to education and opportunities for personal growth?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The picture is tucked away in an old box, but the image of those two little girls has haunted me on many nights. You see, I was the girl on the left, oblivious to the fact that although my ruffled shirt paled in comparison to the intricate lace and frills on my cousin’s white dress, I was born with certain privileges, intangible gifts she would never have the pleasure of knowing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I have often wondered how and why, twenty-seven years later, I am a postgraduate, comfortably situated in the middle class &#8211; while she has a high school education and shares a small room with five siblings. Were her dreams worth less than mine? Did I try harder than she did? Was it just fate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his iconic poem, Robert Frost speaks of two roads diverging in a yellow wood and how he “took the one less travelled by and that has made all the difference.” I, too, can pinpoint several times in my life where I stood at a crossroads and was forced to make a difficult decision: left, right, straight ahead, or turn around? Those decisions no doubt changed the course of my life. But to what extent is our journey the product of the decisions we make?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While studying comparative policy, I came across a phenomenon called path dependence, which explains how early circumstances and decisions set out a specific trajectory of events that are difficult to reverse or change &#8211; like a chain reaction. When I began to apply this theory to my own life, I identified specific differences between my cousin and I, differences that relate to who our parents were and the decisions they made and circumstances they found themselves in before and after our births. I realised that from the moment I was born, I was already on a pathway of privilege and she on a pathway of poverty and hardship. My aspirations and achievements were made possible not by individual persistence and effort alone, but by design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like interwoven threads, our life journeys are made up of complex and unpredictable combinations of our own hard work and dua’s (supplications), and Allah’s will. This reality is captured in the Qur’an and hadith. We are told that we must work hard for our goals:<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #99cc00;">“Man can have nothing but what he strives for; the fruit of his striving will soon come into sight.”</span> </em></strong><em><span style="color: #999999;">(An-Najm:39-40)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>“Never will Allah change the condition of a people until they change it themselves with their own souls.” </strong></em></span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Ar-Ra’d:11)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet we are also reminded that we must be content with whatever Allah (SWT) gives us and that which He chooses to take away, knowing that He (SWT) tests people in different ways and that it is in these tests that we may reap the greatest rewards:</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong><em>“Do you think that you will enter Paradise while such trial has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you?” </em></strong></span><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Al Baqarah:214)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #99cc00;">“Do not wish for that by which God has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned.”</span> </em></strong><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(An-Nisaa’:32)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No fatigue, nor disease, nor sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim, even if it were the prick he receives from a thorn, but that Allah expiates some of his sins for that.”<span style="color: #999999;"> <em>(Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was in these deeply motivating and reassuring words that I ultimately found peace. I will never find a definitive answer as to why the lives of those two little girls evolved as they did. But I have come to realise that both hardships and blessings are tests from Allah (SWT). What will determine our destiny is how we choose to respond to them.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Amina Berete explains a perfect way to cope through the difficult task of facing a new life after taking the shahadah.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember taking your shahadah? How did that make you feel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason why I am asking this question is because I would like to take you through a journey which may be quite similar to yours. And in order for you to fully enjoy the experience, you would need to leave your seat as a spectator and come on stage, putting yourself in Lucy&#8217;s shoes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So today, you have finally decided to become a Muslim. After thinking about it for quite a long time and doing all your research, you are now convinced that Islam is the right path to take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve shared the news with one of your close Muslim friends, and she nicely organised a gathering with other sisters at her local mosque. Being so warmly welcomed by all the sisters and seeing all these beautiful smiles already makes you feel part of another family; you know that you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now comes the moment of truth. Excited and extremely nervous at the same time, your heart is racing and beating so hard that you can hear the resonance of every single beat. You stand up. You can feel you legs and hands shaking. You take a deep breath, and as soon as you start uttering the first words of the shahadah, you feel overwhelmed by a series of emotions you cannot even describe. The shahadah becomes the precious key of freedom sent from Allah (SWT), and you now feel like a bird leaving its cage for the first time, tasting the true sweetness of freedom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve done it! You&#8217;re so proud of yourself, so happy that Allah (SWT) finally gave you the strength to take that step. Your friend and the other sisters are also really happy for you. In turns, they warmly congratulate you and genuinely insist that if you ever need anything, do not hesitate to let them know: &#8220;You&#8217;re now our sister in Islam, and we&#8217;re here to help you!&#8221; How reassuring is it to know that you have sisters you can rely on? Even if you are aware that some challenges will come on your way, their support is the key element that will make any difficulty bearable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days after embracing Islam, some of the storms you expected start showing up. More than ever, this is the time when your sisters&#8217; support is critical. So you start calling them up one by one but they are either not responding or too busy with their own routine. They say that they will get back to you but actually never do, or when they are willing to help, their good intention is not sufficient to improve your situation. So after the sweet honeymoon phase you have been through, comes the time of disappointment. And this is such a difficult phase that it not only leads you to question the sincerity of your dear sisters in Islam, but it also leads you to question Islam itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Muslim now, so why is my life so difficult? What&#8217;s interesting about this question is that the answer is actually within the question itself; once you have recognised that Allah (SWT) is the only One worthy of worship and that you have accepted to fully submit to Him and obey His commands, you will surely be tested to see how strong and sincere your statement is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when you claim to be believing in Allah (SWT), loving Him, trusting Him and doing things for His sake alone, would your claim weaken according to the situation you are in, or will it stay firm and unshakable no matter what?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, does Lucy&#8217;s journey ring a bell for you? If so, that&#8217;s not really surprising, as this is the typical journey of many of our new sisters and brothers in Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality is that we are usually so happy and excited to see new people entering Islam, that out of a generous impulse, we tend to promise a support that is actually beyond our ability, without even realising what the consequences of our lack of commitment could be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had Lucy known that the first contact detail she should have been provided with was Allah&#8217;s direct line through prayer and supplication, this would have helped her to not turn all her hope and expectations on other human beings who are subjected to mistakes and deficiencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The good thing about this challenging phase of loneliness is that it actually teaches us to turn and rely upon Allah (SWT) alone. If you look carefully, you will notice that almost all the greatest prophets like Abraham, Moses, Yusuf, Ayub, Muhammad (may peace be upon them all) went through a phase of isolation which became a learning curve and a way to reinforce their reliance upon Allah (SWT) alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from Allah (SWT), who can really be there for you at any time whenever you need it, without ever getting bored or making you feel that it may not be the most appropriate time to talk? Apart from Allah (SWT), who can really bring you all the support and the best assistance you need in times of difficulties without ever requesting from you anything in return? And who possesses the real power to effectively solve your issues and bring an end to all your concerns and worries, apart from Allah (SWT)?  So why turn to someone else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) tells us in the Qur&#8217;an:<br />
<em><strong><span style="color: #800000;">&#8230; And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him&#8230;</span> </strong></em><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(At-Talaq:2-3)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, knowing who your Lord is and learning how to connect with Him is, without a doubt, the main step to take after taking your shahadah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has the time not come for you to start establishing and developing a strong connection with your Lord? If you haven&#8217;t done so yet, today is the day to start. Don&#8217;t forget to use the two essential tools Allah (SWT), by His immense care and mercy, equipped us with: His final letter, the Qur&#8217;an and His free direct line, the prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Clara McQuaid discusses the important issue of children and exercise, and how it is, in fact, a recommendation of Rasulullah (SAW)]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ibn Umar (RA) reported that our beloved Prophet (SAW) said, “Teach your children swimming, archery and horse riding”. It is also reported in Sahih Muslim that the Prophet (SAW) said, “Practice archery and horseback riding.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I heard a beautiful saying about raising children &#8211; “Play with them for 7 (years), teach them manners for 7, and take them as a companion for 7.”  What strikes me about all of these groups of 7 is the emphasis on the physical and emotional involvement with these humans who are our flesh and blood. Playing, teaching and befriending them. This is the organic, natural way to get to know and help shape the little creations Allah (SWT) has given to our care. We live in a bizarre world in 2012, where technology has hijacked humans; homes often function without real interaction and meaningful communication between the people living in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As parents, guardians, aunts, sisters or family friends, we can lead by example with our young people when it comes to sport and fitness, just as we can in religion, education and manners. Sometimes children will simply fall into a sport or lean towards being active themselves, but very often they need encouragement and participation from a parent or adult. Simply sitting back and saying, “My child is just not sporty”, is a cop out. Recently there were a series of short interviews featuring the mothers of some of the British Olympic champions and premier league player’s mothers. They all spoke of the personal sacrifice they, as mothers, made in order for their child to be able to compete and achieve to such a high level. We may not be aiming for Olympic success, but the benefits of sport for children are huge. Britain has been facing a drain on its resources because of the increase in obesity rates. Children are often sitting down and watching sport on TV, whilst remaining inactive themselves. It is a general governmental recommendation in The UK and the US that children engage in 1 hour of physical activity every day. This can include walking, riding, skating or going on a scooter to school. It can be something as simple as playing with a skipping rope or playing tag with friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exercise does obvious things like reducing body fat, but it also strengthens bones, aids co-ordination, increases balance and flexibility, improves stamina and concentration and reduces anxiety and sadness. When we give our children the gift of sport, we are giving them a means to expend their energy in a fun, halal way that benefits their body and mind, insha Allah. Statistics have shown that children who start young are more likely to exercise as adults, thus carrying the benefits with them. So, start the habit early!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, children growing up in countries where they are part of a Muslim minority need to have a strong character and staying power. Sport can help nurture valuable life skills, which can contribute to this. Sports have the potential to impact your child&#8217;s overall self-esteem, self-worth and confidence. Exercising daily can give children a better outlook on their bodies and fitness levels, and even small children can become more confident when they excel at certain sports. Whether it is martial arts, swimming, basketball or football, mastering a skill gives a child more confidence to try new activities. The American Academy of Pediatrics remarks that with confidence and parental support, sports can positively impact the way children feel about themselves. Sport is an excellent character-building tool. You may think that football entails nothing more than kicking a ball up and down the field, but it subtly incorporates the importance of teamwork and time and conflict management. Losing a game in sport teaches a child how to control their emotions, as well as giving them a goal to work towards. Having training sessions teaches them how to discipline themselves to turn up on time and hopefully put 100% into what they are doing. None of these are intended to take away the fun aspect or enjoyment of the sport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, a parent may need to be patient while their child experiments and finds a sport that they really get into. I sat through a tedious year of judo with my son (sorry any judo fans) before he took to football, something we are still surprised about, as there are no football influences in our home at all. I have friends who are super busy trying to juggle the extracurricular sports their children like, along with the demands of family and all that goes with it. But they persevere, purely because the child enjoys it, and the parent recognises the benefits for their child. Unless your child is at a school with a fantastic, inclusive system of sports, the effort must come from home. Children love nothing better than their parents playing with them. It can be as simple as going to the park with a ball, riding bikes together or taking a family walk &#8211; throwing a picnic into the equation usually helps. Let’s step away from the screens and enjoy our children and enjoy ourselves in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b4cc00;"><strong>Little changes to think about:</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #b4cc00;"><em>Driving.</em></span> Next time you go to do something in the car, ask yourself if you could go by foot instead. Try and develop the habit of walking to places. It’s cheaper, environmentally friendly and you are getting in some exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b4cc00;"><em>Involve the Dads!</em> </span>Set up weekly football matches for the children. Dads can make up the numbers if there are not enough children around. Even better, is having children versus parents. Children always love this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b4cc00;"><em>Do exercise at home.</em></span> This can range from yoga to aerobics, skipping and drill type activities. If you do them with the children, they will inevitably have fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Clara has always loved sports and the great outdoors. Since she was small, one of her favourite places has been an empty field. She has nurtured the love of adventure and nature in her children. She is proud of her eldest son, age 8, who hiked &#8216;as well any adult&#8217; this summer, in Ireland.</em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asalaamu ‘alaikum sisters, and welcome to this article on winter wellness. December and the start of the new year present difficulties for many of us. We may experience challenging emotions at the advent of a new year that then become magnified because we may not be feeling at our best. To top it off, we may be trying to stick to our normal routine and find it a lot more challenging than we normally would. These challenges are often due, in part, to the shorter days and the cold weather. Winter months bring their blessings and their challenges with them, and if we can create a structure on how to manage our wellbeing, then we can make the best of the months ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alhamdulillah, each season brings its own blessings. So, let’s begin by reminding ourselves of some of the blessings of winter. The days are very short, and this is a natural sign for us to slow down; we see this in nature all around us. Animals hibernate, plants shed, lakes freeze and so on. Winter, though brutal on the surface, presents us with opportunities that we may not otherwise claim. It brings us the opportunity to rest and recharge our batteries. We know the importance of reflection within our deen, and winter provides us with an opportunity to take stock of the year gone by, to reflect on how we did, and to plan for where we would like to go. We can only reflect when we are not busy doing things; the cold ensures that we do less. Winter, then, is the perfect opportunity to think and plan for the year ahead. Keep this in mind as you plan your days, so that you allow some space for reflection as you look after your health and wellbeing. Let’s explore some practical ways in which we can really look after ourselves during the winter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Tip 1: Utilise light</strong></span><br />
Light has a direct impact on our sense of wellbeing. Are you usually happier on brighter, sunnier days? Winter can make us feel depressed, simply due to the lack of sunlight. Our body clocks don’t function properly when we don’t experience a sharp difference between light and dark. We need both light and dark for our body clocks to function correctly. What often happens, is that we don’t get enough bright light, and we sit indoors with bright lights, well into the late evening. The key principle to follow is to expose yourself to more light, early on in the day and reduce exposure to light in the evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how do we make this happen? Firstly, we need to be flexible in the winter so we can make the most of the sun when it presents itself. One can’t really plan too far ahead for this, but when there’s sunshine, ensure that you can sit outside or go for a walk. Indeed, doing this whenever you can will help boost your energy levels and your mood. However, you may be located in an area that doesn’t experience much sunlight during winter. Do not despair; there is something you can do. There are a few different types of artificial lights that allow us to get the light we need. The idea with these special lights is that the brain registers the rays as daylight, and so our bodies respond as if we were getting natural light. Invest in one of these and ensure that you get daily exposure during the morning hours. These lights are normally known for treating Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Another option is to get a light that simulates dawn. They allow us to experience waking up with a natural sunrise. Admittedly, these are not the same as being out in the sun, but they play an important role in allowing us to feel productive and well during those dark months. If you keep a very well-lit home at night, then reduce the lighting in the early evening so you can have a restful sleep. Reduce fluorescent lighting and opt for warmer, cosier lighting in the evening time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Tip 2: Get more rest</strong></span><br />
It is probable that you lead a very busy life and have tons to get through in any given day. Do you notice your energy levels are lower during winter? This is nature’s cue telling us to rest. If you have a job, career and a family, it may be challenging to adjust your routine but it will make a real difference to how you feel day to day. Winter demands that you give your body and mind the required rest. Re-evaluate what you’ve got on your plate. Prioritise your to-do list, and focus on the most important things. There will be things that you could delegate to other people (especially in the home), so identify those and delegate them. Next, think about just one or two things that you can either do less frequently or omit altogether, until the spring. If you find that you’re not quite sure or you’re unwilling to let things go, then just try something for 3 days, or a week, and see how you feel. If you feel that it needs to be added back into the routine, then do so, but then choose something else to let go of. Remember, this rest will really support you when it comes to revving up the engines again in the spring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Tip 3: Create an exercise and detox combination</strong></span><br />
Winter does require rest; however, exercise is something you shouldn’t compromise at any time during the year. Keeping active not only helps your body to function better overall, but it has the special benefit of keeping the blues away. Not to mention that exercising in colder weather means that you will burn more kilojoules as well. Do keep the basics in mind, such as good stretching and drinking plenty of water. In addition to the exercise, plan a detox regimen towards the beginning of spring. This is a good time to remove toxins from the system. Consider taking Epsom salt baths, body brushing or bouncing on a trampoline. Whichever detox methods you use, make sure you do some research before you start, and begin slowly so that your body can cope with the de-toxing effects as it energises itself towards spring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Tip 4: Adjust your eating patterns</strong></span><br />
It’s amazing how we can now get a variety of foods flown in from all over the world, meaning that we can eat what we like, rather than the season dictating what we eat. This may not be the best nutrition for our bodies. If we reflect, we notice that Allah I provides us with different fruits and vegetables according to the seasons. Eating seasonal produce will mean that we are giving our bodies the nutrients they require according to the time of year. Experiment with some new foods and try out new recipes, including seasonal produce at least 2-3 times a week. Also, eat an earlier, lighter meal in the evening and have your heavier meals in the morning and lunchtime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Tip 5: Top up on Vitamin D</strong></span><br />
It is often challenging to provide our bodies with the nutrients needed, and one particular vitamin is often neglected. Vitamin D is called a vitamin but it actually works like a hormone, and so, plays a key role in several functions within the body. Having low vitamin D levels will affect our energy levels and our mood, along with various other things. Vitamin D is produced in the skin when we expose ourselves to direct sunlight. So if we don’t get the required exposure for whatever reason, our vitamin D levels are bound to be low. Ensure that you take a vitamin D supplement. If you suspect that your levels may be low, then do go to a doctor and get it tested. Wherever you feel you are at present, vitamin D supplementation will be useful when sunlight is short.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Life coach Sayeda Habib provides insights on how we can utilise a role model to create a life vision.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Assalamu ‘alaikum sisters and welcome to this conversation about creating a life purpose. How did you begin your day today? Did you have something to wake up for? Do you feel that your life has a meaningful purpose? Or are you just living day to day without any real enthusiasm or fulfillment? Each human being needs a sense of purpose in their life. Many of us may already have a definite and clear purpose, but haven’t yet articulated it. If you find yourself falling into this category, then most of your work is already done and putting your vision into words will make it only that much more powerful. If you’re not quite sure where you are, ask yourself the following questions to clarify:<br />
“Am I living a purposeful life?”<br />
“What is the purpose of my life?”<br />
“What am I doing, feeling, hearing and experiencing that tells me that my life has this purpose and that I am living it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may find that you were very clear about the answers. Perhaps you have some idea of what you want your life to be about, but the big picture isn’t quite as clear yet. Perhaps it was there, but, lately, things have become a bit unclear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Do I need a life vision?</strong></span><br />
It may seem that a life vision is for those who have big careers or are busy doing something. On the contrary, a powerful vision connects itself to all our actions in all the areas of our lives. It is about living with a bigger sense of purpose, where we actually focus on impacting others, our community and the world. When we live in this way, we are able to connect various areas of our lives into the larger jigsaw (our vision). Imagine living an inspired life where you are working to make a difference to the world and where the obstacles don’t get you down for long. Imagine waking up with focus; a focus that gives you energy and enthusiasm for life. I imagine that would be a pretty wonderful life and, insha Allah, Allah (SWT) will be pleased with us if we live in this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Muslimahs we know that we are here on this earth to serve Allah (SWT). This is the “what” part of our purpose. What do I need/want to achieve in my life as a Muslim? The personal vision that you hold for yourself answers the question of “how” you will serve Allah (SWT) in your own unique way. The tasks that you take on after this clarity will give your life meaning and energy insha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you find that you have a sense of drive &#8211; you want to do something, but this vision needs some detail? One of my clients went through this. She was working as a nurse and she wanted to help people, but she realised that she wasn’t making the difference that she wanted to make. Large parts of her job and her environment were frustrating her and she wanted to quit and run away. Through coaching, she clarified her vision, which was to make an impact on people’s health through her work as a nurse, but on an entirely different level. She wanted to work in a team where leadership was present and in a different area of nursing entirely. She also wanted to move away and live close to nature. After clarifying her vision, she moved away, got another job and is living in an environment that is much more inspiring for her. By clarifying her vision, she made several changes in her life for the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you require more clarity, where do you begin? One way of clarifying your own vision is to build a connection to someone who does something that truly inspires you &#8211; someone who you see and think “I wish I could do that or be like that.” Having a role model is one way to get encouragement and support when beginning such an important task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Who is a role model?</strong></span><br />
A role model would be someone who holds similar values to you and whose way of being, actions and behaviours are ones that you wish to model in your own life. A role model is a person who you can interact with and learn from in your day-to-day life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Find an accessible role model</strong></span><br />
We are blessed to have wonderful female role models in Islam. Indeed we should learn about them and embody their qualities in order to be successful Muslimahs. However, challenges of modern life require thinking out of the box and practical support. So having a role model we can connect to in a personal way will make a tremendous difference. Imagine having a role model who can personally share their life vision with you. They can teach you by sharing their successes and what they learned from the challenges they faced. By having a role model that you can connect to, you will be able to learn how to create your own vision first hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of five people in your life who you find inspiring. Write down their names and what qualities they have that inspire you. Note down the area(s) of your life where you would want to embody some of these qualities. Perhaps you know a mum who is calm and inspiring with her kids or maybe you know someone who is great at business. Think of the areas of your life that must be included in your vision and find a role model who will help you build a vision in those areas of your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to pick someone who you believe holds similar religious and life values as you (desire to make a difference, trust, sincerity, etc). Remember that their values will show up in their behaviour and will be seen. If they say one thing and behave in another manner then that is not a suitable role model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don’t know someone personally, then reach out to your community to help you connect with someone. Tell them that you are looking for someone to mentor you and insha Allah someone who you can have a personal connection with will emerge. Also, don’t be afraid to take a risk. If there is someone who inspires you, but you don’t know him or her personally, take a leap and find out how to reach them. They may be very willing to help and work with you. Remember that if you do something new and different, you will get a new and different result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Take action</strong></span><br />
Communicating with your role model is the first step. The next step is to take action. Begin carving out a vision statement with the help of your role model. Remember, it can be in the context of your work, parenting or any other context. Begin there and you can make your vision bigger to encompass all areas of your life later on. Next, begin to take some action on what your dream entails. Commit to doing one thing as a minimum (towards your vision) on a daily basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Learn from their mistakes and yours</strong></span><br />
Role models are people too. There will be moments when you may feel discouraged or have an obstacle. Reach out to them, share your challenges and ask them about the challenges they faced. Noticing that they made it through the challenges, and learning about how they did it, will inspire you to continue on the journey as well. Also, make an agreement with them on how often you will speak &#8211; remember, they have commitments and a vision too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is my wish that each of us finds fulfillment and purpose in our lives. Insha Allah we will find a role model that will help us along on the journey. My very best wishes for your success.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hend Hegazi talks to Shelli, a sister who discovered that life was about more than a job title and a large bank balance.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine for a moment that you were transported to a time and place where you had attained the exact measure of worldly success that you had ever aspired to. Would there be anything that could make you bow away from it? Shelli did exactly that. Turning to Allah (SWT) meant letting go of a prestigious job and all the luxuries money can buy &#8211; but it was a change she embraced with the strength and fervour of a true Mu’minah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #d13287;"> <em><strong>(Hend) How did you come to Islam?</strong></em></span><br />
(Shelli) I reverted to Islam, from the Christian faith, after being introduced to it by a friend. Initially I studied the faith in efforts to prove my friend wrong in what he informed me regarding the Islamic perspective on Jesus (AS). In turn, I was proven wrong. Once I had discovered the truth, it was impossible for me not to come to Islam. I studied the faith for about six months before making the decision to convert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d13287;"><strong><em>(Hend) How had you defined yourself up until that point?</em></strong></span><br />
(Shelli) Prior to coming into Islam, I defined myself by all superficial things &#8211; my job title (especially my job!), the amount of money I had in the bank and all that it could buy, what designer label I was wearing and even what ‘knowledge’ I believed I possessed. In hindsight, it was all really silly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #d13287;"><em><strong> (Hend) What made you question the permissibility of your job and your lifestyle?</strong></em></span><br />
(Shelli) I was a Network Engineer in the male dominated field of Information Technology. While that in and of itself is not necessarily haram, the environment lends itself to free-mixing, which is haram. Furthermore, all of the superficial things I placed value upon caused me to be arrogant, looking down upon others who did not have the same things or more. Additionally, my reliance on my own ‘knowledge’ inhibited me from full reliance on Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #d13287;"><strong><em>(Hend) Tell me a little about how you changed this materialistic way of thinking.</em></strong></span><br />
(Shelli) Well, simply the act of offering salat several times a day caused me to take the focus off of me. I had to check my ego at the edge of my prayer mat. Prayer is extremely humbling; I had to bow before Allah (SWT) at a prescribed time. It didn&#8217;t matter what I had going on, I had to stop what I was doing to submit myself in obedience and worship. I also lost the job that ‘defined’ me. The company was going out of business, unbeknownst to me. Alhamdulillah, I was let go just shy of the company going under. Subsequently, all of the other things went with the job. I had no other choice but to understand that who and what I am are not defined by anything that money can buy. The situation caused me to take an introspective look at my life. With the removal of all of the things I thought made me who I was, I was forced to dig a little deeper. I was forced to see who I was &#8211; and I was not so impressed. But it caused me to build upon the attributes that I came to know as more important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #d13287;"><strong><em> (Hend) Was this transformation a struggle?</em></strong></span><br />
(Shelli) It was not easy at all! I had years of practice at being haughty. Plus, it was ingrained in me that ‘your job is your best friend’, as quoted by my mother. I was taught, from a very early age, to believe that where you work, what title you hold and the figures on your paycheck are extremely important. It was hard to shake such thinking. I still struggle. I still have a desire for the status and things. However, understanding that those thoughts and behaviours are not pleasing to Allah (SWT) aids in curbing them. But, it is still not what I would consider easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d13287;"><strong><em>(Hend) How do you define yourself now?</em></strong></span></p>
<p>(Shelli) I now define myself as a Muslim, first and foremost. Then as a woman. Under the umbrella of being a Muslim and a woman, I see myself as a loving wife and mother, a productive contributor to my Ummah, as a counsellor and as a friend. Before, being a Muslim and a woman were not enough. Now they are more than enough, subhan Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d13287;"><em><strong>(Hend) Do you think that you would be happier with the impressive job and the material things that went with it? Do you ever regret this change?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>(Shelli) I am certain I would not be happier with these things in life. I had them and I wasn&#8217;t happy &#8211; I was simply existing. In fact, I was pretty unhappy. I don&#8217;t regret or resent the change. But, like with any other addiction, I have a desire for the familiar occasionally. I am able to abstain only by the grace of Allah (SWT). Desiring for Him to be pleased with me keeps me in a state of determination to leave off those things for good. Knowing that it has been reported that &#8216;leave off something for the sake of Allah, He will replace it with something better&#8217; is enough to keep me going.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d13287;"><strong><em>(Hend) What advice would you give to someone who is too comfortable in a questionable career and materialistic lifestyle that she feels unable to surrender?</em></strong></span></p>
<p>(Shelli) I would tell them that it will not be easy, but that is not to say it is impossible. Do it for the sake of Allah (SWT) and pray that He gives you ease in the transition &#8211; believing sincerely that He will grant your request. If she is feeling that she is unable to surrender, she needs to spend more time learning about the attributes of Allah (SWT). Study His beautiful names &#8211; it will give her a better understanding that nothing is impossible with Him. Study the stories of the prophets and the extreme struggles they faced. If Allah (SWT) could guide them in overcoming situations many of us would have died in, then surely what she faces is easily conquered. Also, check your ego at the door. Release what your mind believes to be true and understand what Allah (SWT) and His Messenger (SAW) have revealed as true! When all else fails, engage in the remembrance of Allah (SWT) &#8211; dhikr, dhikr, and more dhikr!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d13287;"><em><strong>(Hend) How do you think your journey of self-definition &#8211; first from the materialistic labels then elevating to spiritual motivation &#8211; will affect how you raise your own children?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>(Shelli) I want to give my children a more balanced understanding of work, describing it as a means to halal sustenance, a means which does NOT define who you are. Any skill you have is a gift bestowed by Allah (SWT) and not of your own merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These days, it is the norm in many societies for women to put increased focus on their careers. While this is not always negative, it is detrimental if that focus pulls us away from the noble characteristic of humility and humanity and takes us away from our true calling: the worship of Allah (SWT). May Shelli’s experience be a reminder to all of us to keep our spiritual needs in the forefront and our worldly desires in check.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In today’s society, the worth of a Muslim woman is tied to her ability to produce children. Iimaan Shayma challenges this idea b]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Aishah bint Abu Bakr (RA) was the best of women. Her excellence is proven by the privileges bestowed upon her by Allah (SWT). She carried such status with Him that she was the only wife of the Prophet (SAW) to see Angel Jibril (AS) in his human form. She was also the only wife who witnessed revelation come to the Prophet (SAW). She was a strong believer in Islam and her firm belief shaped her life in every way imaginable. One way in which this is evident is through her worship of Allah (SWT) which was, simply put, inspiring. There are narrations of her standing in salah for hours on end, praying and crying to her Lord. Even after the death of the Prophet(SAW)she chose asceticism over the life of luxury that she could&#8217;ve opted for, due to the righteous family and household she belonged to. &#8216;Aishah was so beautifully generous and considerate of the poor, as well as fearful of living a life of unnecessary indulgence. When she was given gifts, she would immediately give them away; when she was given food, she would give it away even if it meant she had none left for herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only was she exceptional in her private and public worshipping of Allah (SWT), &#8216;Aishah was amongst the greatest teachers and scholars of her time. She was one of the three wives who memorised the Qur&#8217;an – along with Umm Salamah (RA) and Hafsah (RA). &#8216;Aishah not only remembered Allah&#8217;s words, but she understood them too, which allowed her to interpret the Qur&#8217;an and provide tafsir. This great woman is considered to be among the earliest of the fuqaha, alongside the likes of Umar ibn Al-Khattab (RA), an expert in fiqh and a jurist on matters of Islamic law. Her memory was exceptional and she had the gift of being able to remember exact speech, as well as when and where she heard it. In &#8216;Aisha: The Wife, the Companion, the Scholar&#8217;, Dr Resit Haylamaz writes that ‘Aishah had photographic memory. She narrated over two thousand ahadith without which we would be ignorant of the most intimate practices between husband and wife. We&#8217;d know very little about how the Prophet (SAW) acted in his home towards his wives were it not for the brave women of Madinah who would seek these answers and the courage of &#8216;Aishah (RA) who would provide them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Her intelligence benefitted the Ummah immensely. Not only was she learned in medicine and genealogy, she was a master of the Arabic language and so flourished among the oral traditions of seventh century Arabia as a poet and naturally eloquent public speaker. The companions would seek her advice and counsel and they sought knowledge from her unashamedly. One of her most successful students was her nephew, ‘Urwah ibn Zubayr (RA), who went on to become one of the greatest scholars of the tabi’een.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;Aishah (RA) was a wife, scholar, teacher, student, altruist and worshipper. She was all of this and more. When considering her status, achievements and excellence, it is important to note that there was one thing &#8216;Aishah was not. Although she retains over the Ummah the rights of motherhood, &#8216;Aishah (RA) had no children of her own. Allah (SWT) never granted her the gift of (biological) motherhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After embarking on marriage, it&#8217;s extremely common for a couple to be bombarded with questions about when they plan to have their first child. If this couple dares go past the year mark without having procreated, they can expect to bear the wrath of the Muslim community, be it from their relatives, their friends or even complete strangers. This incessant pressure to have children is an innovation that did not exist in the time of the Prophet (SAW). Yes, he did encourage us to have lots of children so that on the Day of Judgement his Ummah would be booming. There are indeed many ahadith pertaining to the reward and status of being a mother and we know that one of the main purposes of marriage within Islam is to raise a family in a halal and blessed environment. But the idea that a woman&#8217;s sole purpose in life and in marriage is to have children is incorrect. The prevailing notion that she is less feminine or womanly because she isn&#8217;t a mother is not from Islam. The opinion that motherhood makes women and children make marriages is a concept in modern Muslim society that exists as a consequence of ignorance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Books available to Muslim women inadvertently mirror these beliefs in their failure to cater to sisters with no children. Texts written specifically for women usually contain a large section for the explanation of the reward of parenting and the status of motherhood &#8211; and rightly so. The majority of females in our Ummah have children and so they have a right and a need to access such texts. But I am yet to come across a book written for sisters with no children. Sisters who aren&#8217;t mothers for whatever reason, be it through miscarriage, stillbirth, death at infancy or infertility, are not nearly considered enough in available, modern Islamic literature. The books I read and have come across do not challenge the idea that a Muslimah is no less of a Muslimah if she has no children. And for those who fall into this category, it can be an extremely alienating experience. This, coupled with pressure from in-laws, relatives, friends and strangers, can leave a childless Muslimah feeling lost as to what her purpose is in life. She may begin to feel that she really is less of a woman, perhaps even less of a Muslimah since Allah (SWT) has not given her access to the bountiful rewards that lie in being a mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These beliefs dominate our society both explicitly and implicitly. But our society conveniently forgets about the great women who are the Mothers of the Believers. After the death of Khadijah (RA) the Prophet (SAW) married eleven women. Of these wives, only one bore a child for him &#8211; Maria al-Qibtiyya (RA). Umm Salamah had four children from her previous marriage to Abu Salamah and Sawdah is attributed a son (from a previous marriage) in some narrations and in others she is attributed none. What is clear is that &#8216;Aishah (RA) was the only virgin the Prophet (SAW) married. All of his other wives had husbands before him, some of them more than one. None of these remaining eight wives bore children in their lifetimes, a condition we would refer to today as infertility. As for those who had children from other marriages, who kept relations with the Prophet (SAW) but had no children with him, they can be classified as having experienced secondary infertility. We know that the Prophet (SAW) was able to have children as he had six with Khadijah (RA) and one more with Maria (RA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were these women, our Mothers, pressured into feeling that they must have children? Were they continually asked why they&#8217;d &#8216;failed&#8217; to provide the best of mankind with a son or daughter? Did people raise their eyebrows at them, surprised they still had a husband? Did people dare question their societal or religious status based on their inability to have children? The simple answer is no. The believers of the Prophet&#8217;s era and the generations that followed had too much respect for their wives and sisters and too much fear of Allah (SWT) to add unsubstantiated beliefs and ideas to His perfect way of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The notion that the attainment of femininity and success (whether Islamically or otherwise) lies only in motherhood is not from the Prophetic tradition. The evidence that you don&#8217;t have to be a mother to be among the righteous goes all the way back to the time of Musa (AS), with Asiyah (RA) &#8211; wife of Pharoah &#8211; never having any children of her own. The Prophet (SAW) declared in a hadith that Asiyah is among the best of the women of mankind (Bukhari and Muslim). Her righteousness cannot be doubted. Sarah (RA) – wife of Khalilullah Ibrahim (AS) &#8211; lived a life of infertility until she was granted news of her first child at the age of ninety subhan Allah and Zakariah (AS) and his own wife were unable to have children until Allah (SWT) granted them this blessing in response to Zakariah’s (AS) du’a. It seems that the Muslim community forgets about the number of great women in our history who did not bear their own children. These are all women who have been promised the highest of stations in Jannah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The love between &#8216;Aishah (RA) and the Rasool (SAW) is difficult to describe using mere words. When you read about their relationship and you hear about the love and respect between them, it&#8217;s something all should want for their own marriages. When asked who he loved most, the Prophet (SAW) would answer &#8221;Aishah&#8217; (Bukhari and Muslim). During his last days on Earth, he requested that she be the wife looking after him and all the other wives gracefully accepted this since they knew the happiness she brought him. Allah&#8217;s mercy to mankind died with his head in &#8216;Aishah&#8217;s lap after a decade of marriage with her. &#8216;Aishah was left to continue her life without him for over fifty years before she could join him in death. The Prophet (SAW) loved her so dearly, not despite their lack of children together, but in spite of this. There is no documented evidence that &#8216;Aishah herself, the Prophet (SAW) or his other wives felt in any way deprived due to the absence of their own biological children in their marriages. There is certainly no documented evidence that the Rasool (SAW) had any problem with this. If we, today, have a burning desire out of love to give our husbands children, imagine the desire the Mothers of the Believers must have had to give the best of creation a child. But they are the true believers of Allah (SWT) and His Qadr and alhamdulillah they did not live in a society that made them feel insignificant or incomplete. They understood that being a mother is one of the many ways in which we can worship Allah and gain His pleasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those women who wish to have children but have not yet been blessed with them should know the ease with which they will reproduce in Jannah insha Allah. The Prophet (SAW) said:<br />
“If the believer wants a child in Paradise, the pregnancy and delivery will take only an hour, then the child will be the age that the man wants.”<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad &amp; Ibn Maajah).</em></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Karima umm 'Umar discusses the issue of widows remarrying in the light of Islam and her own experiences.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a widow. My husband died a little over a year ago. He was a loving, caring and gentle man and the perfect companion, so it is nigh on impossible for me to conceive of ever being married to anyone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Muslim, I know that I have been accorded Divine Guidance in every single aspect of my life; I do not have to rely solely on my own, sometimes somewhat wobbly, whims and emotions. So what does Islam say on the subject of widows remarrying?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a Muslim woman loses a spouse, Allah (SWT) has, in His Infinite Mercy and Wisdom, ordained for her an extended mourning period, known as her ‘iddah’, or ‘waiting period’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bd0808;"><em><strong>“If any of you die and leave widows behind they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days: when they have fulfilled their term there is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do.”</strong></em></span><span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Al-Baqarah:234)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I refer to this prescribed waiting period as a mercy because I personally found it so. In Islam, the usual mourning period for the loss of a loved one other than a spouse is three days. To be expected to get over the death of one’s husband in such a short space of time, Allah (SWT) in all His Wisdom knows, is not possible! My husband was someone I relied on heavily. I realise it is a cliché, but he was a rock, a cornerstone in my life. We were, after all, as close as garments to one another. When he died, the fact that I was not expected to move on straight away &#8211; that I was allowed, nay expected and encouraged, to take a considerable length of time to grieve openly and fully &#8211; took an enormous pressure off me, Alhamdulillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friends have become bold lately, as my all-consuming grief diminishes somewhat. They quip that it&#8217;s time I thought about remarrying, that I’m still young and ought not to be struggling alone with the children. They are right, in a way. It’s certainly not easy being on my own, and my three angst-ridden teenagers and zippy four-year-old pose many and varied challenges on a daily basis. Yet this to me seems a prime reason not to remarry. Although it would be wonderful to have someone alongside me to share the load, to shoulder some of the responsibility and the decision-making that I find so very hard at times, would this really be fair to the children? It would depend on the character and intentions of the brother of course, and I may well be blessed with a man who wanted to act as a loving father to my children, as well as a supportive husband to me; but making a wrong choice is far too risky in my mind, in terms of the upbringing and well-being of the children. It is mentioned in Bukhari’s book of manners that &#8216;Awf ibn Malik reported that the Prophet (SAW) said, &#8220;I and a woman who is widowed and is patient with her child will be like these two fingers in the Garden.&#8221; <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it seems that there is a virtue and a great reward in concentrating on nurturing and fulfilling the rights of one’s children, who are after all considered orphans after the death of their father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet we are not all brave and strong enough to endure all of life’s trials alone. Nor does Allah (SWT) expect us to. We were created in pairs alongside all of Allah’s Creation and so it is not natural for us to persevere alone, especially if we are reverts, or sisters with little or no family support. So re-marriage is a perfectly viable and understandable choice to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, like Umm Salamah (RA), I overwhelmingly feel that my late husband is simply irreplaceable. I can relate to her story in this regard, particularly her reluctance to recite the last six words of the du’a she was encouraged to say after her beloved Abu Salamah (RA) died: ‘To Allah we belong, to Allah is our return. O Allah recompense me for my affliction and replace it with something better.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On completing her iddah, first Abu Bakr (RA) and then ‘Umar (RA) proposed to Umm Salamah (RA), yet she declined. When the Prophet (SAW) approached her for marriage she replied: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have three characteristics. I am a woman who is extremely jealous, and I am afraid that you will see in me something that will anger you and cause Allah to punish me. I am a woman who is already advanced in age, and I am a woman who has a young family.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) replied: ‘Regarding the jealousy you mentioned, I pray to Allah the Almighty to let it go away from you. Regarding the question of age you have mentioned, I am afflicted with the same problem as you. Regarding the dependent family you have mentioned, your family is my family.’<br />
This beautiful conversation highlights some of the present day dilemmas widowed sisters may face: quandaries surrounding remarriage if one still has small children and issues of confidence and the reluctance to share one’s life with another man &#8211; one who may not be able to live up to the good character of one’s late husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Umm Salamah’s story helps us widowed sisters to understand and to have hope in the fact that Allah (SWT) can replace something that we hold so dear with something even better if we ask and expect Him to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband actually encouraged me towards remarriage many times during his illness, giving me his ‘blessing’ as it were, so I would not shoulder any guilt as some widows may when considering this step. A pressing question for me is, presuming I did remarry, who then would be my husband in Jannah, insha Allah?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Al-Albaani authenticated a hadith, which states that our Prophet (SAW) said: “The woman will be for her last husband in Paradise.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing this would heavily influence any remarrying decisions for me as I often ponder on the hope and pray for the day that my late husband and I will be reunited insha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imaam &#8216;Abdul-&#8216; Aziz bin &#8216;Abdillah bin Baz has mentioned other hadiths, in which the chains of narration are weak and debated, that state that if a woman was married more than once, she may choose the husband with the best character in Jannah. However, Imaam &#8216;Abdul-&#8216; Aziz bin &#8216;Abdillah bin Baz states that it is of course ultimately up to Allah (SWT) to determine this issue. He I knows best what will happen on the Day of Judgement and in the life hereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many myths and misconceptions surround the question of whether or not widows are allowed to remarry. The aforementioned quote from Surat Al-Baqarah <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(2:234)</em></span> dispels those myths in one fell swoop, as does the fact that we know that our Prophet’s (SAW) first wife Khadija (RA) was a widow when she proposed to him (SAW). So not only is it definitely permissible in Islam for a widowed woman to remarry, but she may take the initiative and actually be the one to propose!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can see then, from an Islamic perspective, that should a widow one day choose to remarry, there is nothing wrong with fulfilling that need, and we are well within our rights to do so. Yet if we are able to cope alone and choose not to remarry, there is great virtue and reward in that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in all situations and dilemmas we face in life, Islam serves only to make things easier for us, giving us choices and catering for our individual circumstances and needs. Alhamdulillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When my friend was a child, her parents taught her how she was supposed to greet her grandparents when they visited. She was trained to “put her head inside her stomach” (to translate the Urdu phrase literally), which practically meant that she and the other family children would bow before their grandparents almost to the position of ruku in salah, with their hands covering their noses, saying “aadaab” (“respects”), instead of the Islamic greeting of “Assalamu alaikum”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even today, in some Muslim cultures, it is considered extremely disrespectful if younger people do not stand up immediately when elders arrive. It is also deemed disrespectful to watch physically healthy elders perform their tasks and errands themselves, such as cleaning or polishing their shoes or washing and ironing their clothes. The “head” position of the dining table is reserved strictly for the oldest person in the household. If they have to be driven somewhere in the car, they must occupy the front seat next to the driver &#8211;  a seat reserved for the most authoritative person in the family who is not driving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grew up in a culture that unequivocally holds elders in high esteem and affords them enormous respect and reverence, which is, in principle and essence, directly in accordance with the tenets and injunctions of Islam:</p>
<p>Anas bin Malik narrated, “An older man came to talk to the Prophet, and the people were hesitant to make room for him. The Prophet said: ‘He is not one of us who does not have mercy on our young and does not respect our elders’.” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Al-Tirmidhi)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, experience of life has taught me that we need to be very careful about letting our reverence of elders inch towards the greatest sin: shirk, or associating partners with Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Obeying the Created in Disobedience of the Creator</strong></span><br />
Besides practicing or acquiescing to the culturally prevalent social etiquettes of respecting elders that border on shirk, like the example of children bowing before grandparents, we should also avoid those displays of respect that contradict the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (SAW), e.g. even though our Prophet (SAW) exhorted believers to make room for an elder when the latter arrived at a gathering, he disliked people standing up for him when he himself arrived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem starts when Muslims equate the respect of elders with submissive silence in front of their transgressions. Many young people tend to stand by mutely out of fear of ‘disrespecting’ elders, as the latter commit open injustice. A very blatant example of this, which is very prevalent in the area from where I hail, is how daughters and sisters are customarily and knowingly deprived of their rightful shares of inheritance. Instead, they are given a dowry at the time of their marriage, which is considered ample ‘compensation’. When someone in the family dies, the females are coerced by older men in authority, such as grandfathers, fathers, husbands and older brothers, to ‘surrender’ their shares by signing on legal documents that they are not even allowed to read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example is the often inhuman way domestic employees and maids are treated by elders who run the home. It is not uncommon for the matriarch of a house to shout and yell at a maid in front of household members for making a small mistake. Many affluent housewives quickly accuse their maids of stealing anything that goes missing from their palatial homes as the accused begs for mercy and denies it. Weeks or months after the said maid is ceremoniously fired for this, the missing item surfaces. Yet, no one in the household who watched the whole spectacle, dares to remind their elderly mother or grandmother of the major sin she has incurred upon herself by defaming her former maid’s honour and slandering her in public. Reason? It’ll be ‘disrespectful’ to remind the matriarch that her behaviour warrants repentance before Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet another example is how an adult son submissively obeys his aging father in agreeing to undertake fraudulent financial transactions, including those dealing directly in <em>riba</em> (usury). Afraid of displeasing his elderly father, a son does exactly as he is told whilst running the family business, even if it means lying on paper or committing perjury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many religiously-inclined Muslims in the country where I live thus submissively obey their elders unconditionally, notably their parents and grandparents, knowingly becoming passive supporters of actions that are forbidden in Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one dares utter a peep out of fear of disrespecting their elders and making them angry. If someone reminds them of the prohibition of obeying any created human being in disobedience of the Creator, they promptly quote Qur’an and ahadith detailing the greatness of the parents’ rights and the obligation of honouring elders in Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My Wakeup Call</strong></span><br />
I by and large adhered to the philosophy of “older people are always right” till the time I was in my twenties, despite this becoming increasingly frustrating for me as I grew older. There were times when all my worldly knowledge, human logic and common sense indicated that what an older person was emphatically saying was wrong, yet I grudgingly remained silent in front of them, out of respect. It was all about acquiescing before authority on the basis of fear of admonishment. As Allah (SWT) granted me more knowledge of the Qur’an and of the seerah of Prophet Muhammad (SAW), many things began to become clearer to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Prophet Ibrahim and his Father</strong></span><br />
Now that you have an idea of the kind of effects the culture from which I hail had on my younger, naive psyche, you might understand how and why I was rather shocked to discover some of the things that Prophet Ibrahim (AS) said to his father, Azar. Allah (SWT) has narrated these ayat in the Quran as part of a dialogue:</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #008080;">“Behold, he said to his father: “O my father! Why worship that which hears not and sees not and cannot profit you?”</span> </em></strong><span style="color: #999999;"><em>[19:42]</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ibrahim (AS) openly challenged his father’s beliefs as a youth. Please keep in mind that his father was a non-Muslim polytheist who worshipped many gods. Nevertheless, the obligation of respecting his father didn’t stop the confident young Ibrahim (AS) from appealing to his human logic and common sense in order to entreat him to worship only one god, at one point clearly saying, “I see you and your people in open misguidance!” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>[6:74]</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These verses of the Qur’an shocked the daylights out of me. I could never imagine saying such a thing to a parent, because it would be considered extremely disrespectful in the society in which I was brought up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The Critical Balance</strong></span><br />
I am aware how many Muslims tend to view things from polarised ends: either they go to one extreme of respecting elders and bygone forefathers to the extent that they give the pleasure of their elders preference over the pleasure of Allah (SWT). At the other extreme, young people become so rude and disobedient towards their elders that they raise their voices and talk back at them and disregard their feelings and preferences totally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to remind every reader that we have to maintain a critical balance. Allah’s (SWT) pleasure should always reign supreme for us all. Not even our elders &#8211; be they bygone forefathers or those who are alive &#8211; deserve the kind of awe and reverence that should be reserved only for Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elders are not above correction and sincere <em>nasihah</em> (reminding), especially when they err and/or consistently commit sins. If we see our elders doing something on a habitual basis that displeases Allah (SWT), it is obligatory upon us to remind them to abstain from it and to fear Allah (SWT). However, in doing so, we should use the most loving, kind and gentle tone. We must never rebuke them or speak to them rudely or disrespectfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Sadaf Farooqi secretly fears that if she lives to be very old, no one will correct her for fear of ‘disrespecting’ an elder.</em></span></p>
