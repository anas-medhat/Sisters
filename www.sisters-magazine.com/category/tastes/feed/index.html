		<description><![CDATA[Even diehard meat eaters will love this brightly coloured vegetarian meal from Clara McQuaid.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My sister’s family are all vegetarian, so when they were visiting recently I wanted to make them a unique vegetarian dish. All too often vegetarians get the rough end of the deal in restaurants, and people feel nervous about catering for them in their homes as well. This wellington was a huge success, and I recommend it for everyone, vegetarian and meat lovers alike. It’s not labour intensive, either &#8211; in fact it cuts a lot of corners but in an acceptable way, I think. The finished result is a loaf with colourful layers of delicious vegetables that looks very impressive when you slice it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #6282b5;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
• 320 gram sheet ready rolled puff pastry, or approximately 35cm x 23cm<br />
• 100 grams risotto rice<br />
• 450 ml vegetable stock<br />
• 25 grams freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br />
• 1 egg, beaten<br />
• 3 tablespoons cream<br />
• Handful fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped<br />
• Handful fresh basil, chopped<br />
• 200 grams jar roasted red peppers<br />
• 200 gram jar chargrilled aubergines<br />
• 100 grams buffalo mozzarella, drained and thinly sliced<br />
• 200 gram jar baby artichokes, or hearts, drained and sliced<br />
• 2 garlic cloves, sliced<br />
• Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />
• Dressed rocket salad to serve</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #6282b5;"> <strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Heat the oven to 200°C. Lay a sheet of puff pastry in a 22cm x 12cm non-stick loaf tin, pressing into the corners and leaving the excess hanging over the sides. Chill in the fridge while you prepare the filling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
2. Place the risotto rice in a pan and cover with the stock. Add salt to taste. Leave to cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is nearly cooked. Stir in the grated Parmesan and remove from the heat &#8211; the risotto will continue to swell and cook. Spread the risotto mixture on to a tray to prevent it from cooking any longer. Leave to cool completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Placed the rice in a bowl with the egg and cream, parsley and basil, then season to taste. Spoon half into the bottom of the pastry-lined loaf tin. Arrange a layer of the red pepper quarters on top followed by the artichokes, mozzarella cheese, garlic and aubergine slices. Cover with the remaining rice. Fold over the pastry to enclose the filling, cutting away any excess and using it to patch up where necessary. Lightly wet your fingers and seal the pastry edges to ensure the filling doesn’t seep out during cooking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Place the wellington on a baking tray and bake for 50 mins to 1 hour, until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is heated through. Leave to cool for 5 minutes in the loaf tin and turn out on to a platter to serve, or leave on a wire rack to cool completely. It’s fantastic eaten hot or cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Savour the flavour of summer a little while longer with this delicious recipe by Clara McQuaid.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a summer of coulis in our house, and a great deal of desserts to go with it! The joy of holidays. It&#8217;s been quite a fruity revelation for me. I think that sauces often kick a dish from just regular ‘okay’ to fantastic &#8211; they add that little extra that makes all the difference in terms of taste, and usually they have the added bonus of having a pleasing aesthetic quality. A coulis is an easily made, highly versatile fruit puree. It is spectacular with pavlova and Eton mess because the tart, fruity flavour cuts through the cream and sweetness of the meringue.<br />
The turning point for me was its utility when it comes to Victoria sponges and Bakewell tarts. I use coulis where jam is usually added, and then put some in a piping bag and drizzle it over the top of the Victoria sponge that already has buttercream and fresh fruit on. Seriously delicious. The other advantage is that it can be made with fresh or frozen fruit, and it keeps for at least a week in a jar in the fridge &#8211; or you can freeze it and defrost it when you need to. I have given a few variations of ingredients here, but practically any fruit can be turned into a coulis, and you can sweeten it to your taste as you get to know the flavours better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Mixed Berry Coulis</strong></span><br />
Makes 200 mL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></span><br />
• 200 grams fresh raspberries, blackberries, stoned fresh cherries, or mixed berries<br />
• 50 grams caster sugar<br />
• 50 ml water</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>Method</em></strong></span><br />
Place all of the ingredients in a medium sized heavy-based pan and bring to the boil over a gentle heat, stirring all the time. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, or until thickened.<br />
Allow to cool and transfer the coulis to a liquidiser, or use a hand blender to puree. Finally, pass it through a sieve, pushing the pulp through with a wooden spoon to get the most out of your fruit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Or try these variations, using the same method:</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Apple</strong></span><br />
• 2 eating apples, cored and sliced with the skin still on<br />
• 1 vanilla pod scraped out<br />
• 300 mL fresh pressed apple juice<br />
• Squeeze of lemon juice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Strawberry </strong></span><br />
• 400 grams strawberries hulled and halved (or frozen)<br />
• 75 grams caster sugar<br />
• A teaspoon lemon juice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Tomato</strong></span><br />
This is not a typo! It jazzes up savoury dishes, and unlike all of the other coulis mentioned above, it needs no cooking at all &#8211; just jump straight to the liquidiser stage.This goes so well spooned over the top of fish and vegetables. Trust me.</p>
<p>• 250 grams cherry tomatoes<br />
• A large pinch of caster sugar<br />
• A teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Learn to make your very own focaccia bread with this easy recipe from Yvonne Maffei.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s such a good skill to know how to make all kinds of bread, a basic food staple, from scratch. This is a simple, no-fuss recipe for focaccia bread (an Italian flat bread). I’ve memorised it, not because I’ve made it so many times or because it’s so versatile, but simply because I’ve always felt it necessary to know the recipe without relying on a cookbook. It is made from flour, yeast, water, oil and salt &#8211; five ingredients that sustain us and fill our stomachs in times of excess, but also in times of need, Alhamdulillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
1 cup warm water<br />
10 g active dry yeast<br />
250 g plain flour<br />
60 ml olive oil + 2 tbs olive oil<br />
1 tsp salt</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. In the bowl of a food processor or stand mixer, add warm water and drop the yeast in. Let it stand to proof for about ten minutes.<br />
2. Add 1 cup of flour along with the salt and pulse the processor, or use the dough hook of the mixer to blend thoroughly.<br />
3. Add the rest of the flour and the olive oil and mix well until you have a ball of dough that is not sticky, but is smooth and elastic.<br />
4. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise for about 30 minutes.<br />
5. On a floured counter or flat surface punch out the dough to form either a large circle or rectangular shape. Place onto a baking sheet covered in parchment paper.<br />
6. Preheat the oven to 204°C.<br />
7. Using the teeth of a fork, poke holes all over the dough. Then, using the pad of your fingers, poke the dough lightly in various places to form indentations. Cover with a towel and allow the dough to rest for another 30 minutes or until it has risen.<br />
8. Using a pastry brush, rub the extra oil all over the surface of the bread dough.<br />
9. Place the bread into the hot oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until is a golden brown on top. Be careful not to overcook or it will become very hard.<br />
10. Serve as a flat bread with olive oil for dipping or make additions to the dough before baking, such as adding cheese, cooked ground meat, or thinly sliced veggies on top.</p>

<p>Spring time is crumble time. Well, that&#8217;s not quite true: any time is crumble time really, its always a crowd pleaser. But in spring when you are not quite out of the Winter but not yet into the Summer, it&#8217;s nice to combine the fresh fruitiness of the beckoning summer with comforting warm crumbliness that&#8217;s reminiscent of chillier days. Anyway, there&#8217;s no need to justify baking this treat.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Make peanut butter on the fly with Yvonne Maffei’s recipe for a homemade spread.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can something so simple not be made at home? Peanut butter is such a favourite food spread for kids (and many adults) that it’s a shame not to have it freshly made. It’s quick and easy to make and simple enough to make a jar a week and even pass some along to family and friends as edible gifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Makes about 1 ½ cups</em><br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #b87e02;">Ingredients</span></em></strong><br />
• 142 g (1 cup) unsalted, roasted and shelled peanuts<br />
• ½ tsp salt, or to taste<br />
• 28 g raw cane sugar, or to taste<br />
• 1½ cups peanut or safflower oil<br />
<span style="color: #b87e02;"><strong><em>Method</em></strong></span><br />
In a food processor, pour the peanuts, salt and sugar. Blend until the nuts have been completely crushed.<br />
Add the oil half a cup at a time, while continuing to blend, until you reach the desired consistency of peanut butter. For a crunchier peanut butter, add a few more peanuts and process them slightly, not until completely smooth.<br />
Pour into a container that can be sealed tightly and store in the refrigerator upside down. When ready to use, turn over and use a fork or spoon to mix the oil back into the peanut butter. Keeps fresh for about two weeks.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this installment of Musings of a Foodie, Fatima Bheekoo-Shah relates how Sunday lunch is making a comeback in her home. 
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sundays are like a double-edged sword for me. Whilst it is still the weekend, it also a day closer to Monday, when the mad dash to get to work and school on time begins. Sundays were also made for long leisurely lunches with family. The kind where the table is groaning under the sheer weight of the amount of food piled on top of it. Roast chicken or lamb, roasted potatoes, plump sweet yellow rice, carrots, caramelised butternut, the unique South African gem squash which should have pools of melted butter in them, and salads complete the main part of the meal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sundays also take me back to my granny and her salt and pepper roast chicken.  It was so delicious that even after more than twenty years that meal still remains sharp in my memory. I remember everything from the crispy golden-brown chicken sizzling with some potatoes in an electric frying pan to the aroma that embraced you the minute you came in through the front door. Sunday was just not Sunday without it. I have tried and tried to copy that recipe and get it right, but I still do not get any closer to the way my granny makes it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I have taken to cooking Sunday lunch. I used to be happy to get take-out or have a late breakfast and just have a light supper. But Sundays are our only day as a family when we can have leisurely lunch together.  So I try to make the effort and cook and the best part is there is no rush as everyone is quite happy to eat when the food is done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roasted anything is usually on the menu, but to make the hubby happy it has to be the customary roast leg of lamb. After years of experimenting, I think I have found the perfect recipe for us. After I freshly grind the roasted spices and marinate the meat, I sear the meat to get that perfect golden brown colour, then into a slow oven to roast for a few hours. Once the meat has cooked and all the lovely juices have oozed out, I throw in a few parboiled potatoes and roast them to perfection in the meat juices. We usually have the meat with some roasted veg, rice and a green salad. Dessert is often much later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I go through all this trouble because there are very few things that bring such genuine happiness and closeness into homes as a proper Sunday lunch. And the reason for this is not because of the food, but because of the laughter and memories that are formed around the table. I suppose it’s like that all over the world. Every person, no matter how rich or poor, has a memory that is directly related to food. Whether it is your mother giving you warm chicken soup and toast when you are ill or your BFF feeding you chocolate cake when you are feeling down or just having ramen noodles with the kids, everyone has a food memory. These memories are what holds communities and families together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the task of perfecting my granny’s roast chicken recipe still continues…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>My Roasted Leg Of Lamb Recipe</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
<em>The lamb</em><br />
• 2kg good quality leg of lamb<br />
• 5 whole cloves of garlic<br />
• 1 red chilli<br />
• 1 tsp mustard powder<br />
• 2 tbsp roasted coriander seeds<br />
• ½ tsp roasted cumin seeds<br />
• 1 small bunch of fresh coriander leaves<br />
• 2 tbsp olive oil<br />
• Freshly ground black pepper &#8211; be generous!<br />
• Zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mint sauce</em><br />
• 4 tbsp chopped fresh mint leaves<br />
• 1 tsp sugar<br />
• 2 pinches salt<br />
• 1 tbsp hot water<br />
• 3 tbsp white vinegar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Preheat your oven to 160°C.<br />
2. In a small kitchen processor, grind all the herbs and spices to a fine, smooth paste.<br />
3. Make deep slits with a sharp knife in your meat. Smear the paste all over the lamb, making sure you get the paste well into the slits.<br />
4. Seal your lamb on a hot grill if you wish, then place it in the oven directly on the rack.<br />
5. Cook the lamb for about an hour and 30 minutes if you want it pink or another half hour if you want it more well done.<br />
6. Meanwhile, prepare your mint sauce. To make the mint sauce, mix the chopped mint, sugar, salt, hot water and vinegar.<br />
7. Take the lamb out of the oven and cover with tin foil. Leave for 15 minutes before serving. Carve and serve with roasted potatoes and mint sauce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Fatima Bheekoo-Shah shares a breakfast recipe that might just become a staple in your repertoire.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eggs are one of the most nutritious foods you can find. I love eggs in all forms: fried, scrambled, poached and boiled. When I want something different though, shakshuka is my staple. Poaching eggs in a flavoursome, aromatic tomato sauce is all the rage in South Africa. It is warming, comforting and nutritious. This dish is ideal for the days you wake up feeling in the mood for a simple culinary challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Shakshuka has been a part of the cuisine of North Africa and the Middle East for many years. They have many variations on this theme depending on the country in which it’s made, with sauces varying in spiciness, sweetness and sharpness. You can add preserved lemon to your shakshuka &#8211; or why not try harissa paste, olives or even sausage? This recipe is also a great side dish at the brunch table. Most importantly, have loads of crisp sourdough bread on hand to mop up the juices!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #a80000;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
• 1 tbsp olive oil<br />
• 1 medium brown or white onion, peeled and diced<br />
• 1 clove garlic, minced<br />
• 1 medium green or red bell pepper, chopped<br />
• 4 cups ripe diced tomatoes, or 2 cans (400 ml each) diced tomatoes<br />
• 2 tbsp tomato paste<br />
• 1 tsp chilli powder (mild)<br />
• 1 tsp cumin<br />
• 1 tsp paprika<br />
• A pinch of cayenne pepper (or more to taste if you like it spicy!)<br />
• A pinch of sugar (optional, to taste)<br />
• Salt and pepper to taste<br />
• 5-6 eggs<br />
• Freshly chopped coriander (optional, for garnish)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #a80000;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Heat a deep, large skillet or sauté pan on a medium heat. Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion and sauté for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
2. Add garlic and continue to sauté until mixture is fragrant. Add the bell pepper and sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened. Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, and stir until blended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
3. Add spices and sugar (if using), stir well and allow mixture to simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes until it starts to reduce. At this point, you can taste the mixture and spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
4. Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the sauce. I usually place 4-5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the centre. The eggs will cook &#8220;over easy&#8221; style on top of the tomato sauce. Cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
5. Keep an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn&#8217;t reduce too much, which can lead to burning. Some people prefer their shakshuka eggs more runny. If this is your preference, let the sauce reduce for a few minutes before cracking the eggs on top. Then, cover the pan and cook the eggs to taste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
6. Garnish with the chopped coriander, if desired. Shakshuka can be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner. For breakfast, serve with warm crusty bread or pita that can be dipped into the sauce.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Use up your about-to-expire milk with Meltem Baykaner's recipe for creamy chocolate pudding.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All food is important and a sign of Allah’s many blessings upon us; but there is something deeply, historically precious about milk. It is a reminder of birth, growth and new life &#8211; but, just as all life is fleeting, milk has a brief shelf life too. So before throwing out that milk that is just days away from coming to the end of its time in your fridge, consider the importance of not being wasteful and transform it into this deliciously smooth chocolate pudding that can be made with store cupboard ingredients &#8211; and is bound to be a hit with children and adults alike!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #800000;"><em><strong> Milk Chocolate Pudding</strong></em></span><br />
<em> Serves 4</em><br />
<em> Cooking time: 30 minutes</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #800000;"> <strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
600 ml cow’s milk of choice<br />
4 tsp corn flour<br />
80 g caster sugar<br />
3 tsp cocoa powder<br />
1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
Put all dry ingredients in a medium sized saucepan and pour in 100 ml of the milk, stirring until combined and smooth.<br />
In a microwave, heat the remaining 500 ml milk until warm (but not boiling).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put the saucepan on the stove over a low heat, slowly pouring in the rest of your milk and the vanilla extract, if using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stir continuously with a wooden spoon, gradually turning the heat up to medium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep stirring &#8211; as the temperature rises, the pudding will begin to thicken on the bottom of the pan. If it becomes lumpy, turn down the heat and whisk gently until it is smooth again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continue to stir or whisk on a medium heat until the mixture has thickened to a slightly runny custard consistency. If you would like it thicker, continue to stir it whilst it&#8217;s on the stove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pour into four ramekins, or if you’d prefer, put all of the pudding into one medium sized bowl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leave to cool at room temperature for an hour, and then place in the fridge until set and ready to serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serve with whipped cream, berries, nuts or just as it is &#8211; enjoy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Variations:</em> You can also try omitting the cocoa powder and making this a plain vanilla pudding, or even try different flavourings such as cinnamon, almond or mint extracts. This pudding is also delicious warm, straight from the pan!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Chicago-Style Pulled Beef Sandwiches</strong></span><br />
<em>“The great city of Chicago in the heart of the U.S.A. is known for its food. The famous Italian beef sandwiches were created to meet the demands of Italian families during the Great Depression who wanted to stretch their dollars while still enjoying meat. Meat was thinly sliced and served on bread rolls in response to those demands. Though the exact origins are somewhat debatable, everyone agrees that it’s still one of the most popular sandwiches in the city.”</em> &#8211; Yvonne</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4540" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/shutterstock_37860952-1024x678.jpg" alt="shutterstock_37860952" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/shutterstock_37860952-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/shutterstock_37860952-768x508.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/shutterstock_37860952-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/shutterstock_37860952-257x170.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><br />
<em><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Ingredients</span></strong></em><br />
• 1 kg boneless bottom round beef (in one whole piece)<br />
• 30 ml olive oil<br />
• 250 g yellow onions, thinly sliced<br />
• 2.5 g black pepper<br />
• 20 g garlic cloves, minced<br />
• 425 g gardiniera (or a mix of chopped celery, cauliflower, and Spanish olives in oil)<br />
• 6 Hoagie rolls or French bread rolls cut in half and opened</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>Method</em></strong></span><br />
1. Dry the meat thoroughly and bring to room temperature before cooking. Dry meat browns nicely. When it is brought to room temperature as opposed to being put in a hot pan when cold, it will have less of a tendency to stick to the pan and tear.<br />
2. In a large, deep pan such as a Dutch oven, heat the the oil over a medium flame. Add the meat and brown on all slides, about five minutes each side.<br />
3. Add the onions directly to the pot and sauté until nicely browned and translucent.<br />
4. Add the garlic, salt, pepper and gardiniera. Cook for five minutes then cover. Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 3 hours.<br />
5. Check on the meat, which should easily pull apart with a fork. Take it out of the pot and onto a cutting board. Cover and let it rest for about ten minutes.<br />
7. Uncover the meat and slice the entire piece thinly, lengthwise, or pull apart gently with a fork.<br />
8. Bring all the meat back to the pot. Stir and keep it warm until ready to serve.<br />
9. Warm the bread in an oven or toaster. Use tongs to grab the meat and place a generous amount inside of each roll and serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>BBQ Pulled Chicken Sandwiches</strong></span><br />
<em>“BBQ is a tradition in the Southern area of the United States, a place that you will find almost everything being grilled or smoked. Pulled Chicken sandwiches with French fries and ice cold lemonade are Southern favourites, especially on a hot summer day. To save time in the kitchen you can make the marinade and sauce ahead of time and use them when needed.”</em> – Noor</p>

<em>“Whether it is for breakfast, lunch, or simply a midday snack, sandwiches are your go-to item. They are convenient to pack as your kids’ lunch or even as picnic food. This recipe is for a stuffed sandwich, filled with delicacies such as mushroom, onions, tomatoes and finally garnished with sweet-smelling oregano.”</em> &#8211; Kanika</p>

<p><span style="color: #800000;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
• 8 bread slices (white bread is better for presentation but brown is definitely healthier)<br />
• 2 tbsp butter<br />
• 2 tsp plain flour<br />
• ¼ cup chopped onions<br />
• 1 finely chopped green chilli<br />
• ½ cup finely chopped mushrooms<br />
• ½ tsp dried oregano<br />
• salt and pepper to taste<br />
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>Method</em></strong></span><br />
1. Start off by heating 1 tbsp butter in a pan and sauté onions in it until they are whitish-golden in colour.<br />
2. Next, add chilli and plain flour to the onion mix and continue to fry it.<br />
3. After about 30 seconds, add mushrooms, oregano, salt and pepper to the mix and cook well on medium-high heat for about 2-3 minutes. Mushrooms should be extremely soft at the end of this process.<br />
4. Trim away the edges of the bread slices and cut each slice into 2 equal rectangles.<br />
5. Toast each slice till it is golden brown on a flat pan or oven.<br />
6. Spread butter on one side of each slice.<br />
7. Spread the filling uniformly on the buttered side and close it up in with another slice of bread. Finish off with a garnish of parsley and tomatoes and serve immediately. Or, pack it away in lunch boxes to enjoy later.</p>

<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Gatsby Sandwich</strong></span><br />
<em>“A Gatsby is a traditional and popular Cape Town fast food sandwich. It’s a family size sandwich using a wide French loaf bread/baguette. The sandwich does not have a definitive recipe as it uses a broad range of available sauces, fillings. This is messy finger food of the best kind. Salads are optional as this is not the best example of healthy food.”</em> – Fatima</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Safia A. discusses the need for a healthy diet and explores the benefits of a raw food diet.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hippocrates is known to have said “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”, a powerful statement of wisdom that contains the secret to good health. With all our advances in medicine and technology, it is astounding to see how ill most of us are, especially in the West where diabetes, obesity, heart problems and all manner of illnesses are on the rise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how can food heal us? Most of us have inherited from our parents a food lifestyle that we never thought to question. We cook, we eat (or for many families nowadays, we buy, we heat, we eat). But what if there is a better way? A way that helps us recover our health and look and feel ten years younger?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Eating raw</strong></span><br />
I was first introduced to the raw foods lifestyle when I picked up a copy of Raw Energy by Leslie and Susannah Kenton. A whole new world opened to me as I realised that there are people out there who almost never cook their food and yet what they eat is tasty, varied and in its best form to release its vitamins and minerals. The authors maintain that a raw food diet slows aging, energises at a physical and emotional level and helps the body fight off infections and stress with ease. They give inspiring examples of people like Max Gerson – a physician who cured migraines, lupus (which is ‘incurable’) and even cancer using raw foods – and Ann Wigmore, founder of the Hippocrates Health Institute (HHI). Wigmore was very ill and aging fast when she turned to raw foods in desperation. Her illnesses disappeared, her grey hairs became dark again and she started to look years younger. The HHI has successfully treated numerous people in all stages of illness and taught them how to live a raw food lifestyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Why eat raw?</strong></span><br />
Quite simply, to unlock the powerful nutrients and enzymes that raw foods contain; these are usually killed off at high temperatures and we end up eating ‘dead’ food instead. Even worse, a significant chunk of the population depends on processed food, which is NOT food, merely junk masquerading as food. All the cereals, energy bars, frozen foods and packaged goodies lining the supermarket aisles are the cause of our declining health. And when in desperation we visit our doctor, he is just as clueless and ends up prescribing a ‘pill for every ill’ to treat symptoms rather than address the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we heat foods above 48°C we destroy live enzymes that assist in digestion and health. Raw foods alkalise the body, which helps to flush out toxins from cooked food. Cooked foods build up acidic toxins and can lead to weight gain and disease. Because raw food is nutritionally dense, even a small quantity is more filling than a larger quantity of cooked food. The latter may taste nicer (as that is what we are used to) but all we’ve done is consume empty calories, hence we get hungrier quicker as our body still craves the necessary nutrients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still need convincing, consider this: in the Qur’an, every time Allah mentions halal He (SWT) also mentions <em>tayyib</em> (good and pure), with regard to our food. While we beat the halal drum very loudly, we almost always overlook <em>tayyib</em> – halal pizza and burgers? Ok! Never mind that the condition of <em>tayyib</em> has not been met by a mile. So if <em>tayyib</em> means pure, what’s more pure than food in its raw state? These are very good reasons to try raw foods and see how they affect our health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Who is a raw foodie?</span></strong><br />
Anyone whose diet consists of 75% or more raw, live, nutritionally dense, unprocessed foods is considered to be a raw foodie. For the majority, we are nowhere near that goal and many of us will never be raw foodies. But there is no reason why we can’t start the journey and then stay at the level that works for our health. Another way to approach this is to go on a raw ‘diet’ – a 3, 5, or 10 day period during which we consume only raw foods, to detox and renew ourselves &#8211; a kind of battery recharge. If we can do so every now and again, we will equip our bodies with the means to flush out the build-up of toxins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">How to begin the journey</span></strong><br />
Admittedly, most of us will never go fully raw, but we can all incorporate raw elements into our diet and build up gradually. The easiest ways to begin are to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">1.</span> Include freshly made salads as the main item at meal times. Instead of taking a huge helping of steak and creamy mash, try to reduce the cooked food on your plate and increase the amount of salad. With so many varieties of salad to try, I am sure there is something out there for everyone, even those who dismiss such foods as ‘rabbit food’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">2.</span> Make fresh juices a daily part of your food intake. This means buying a powerful blender or juicer; the former will pulverise all the fibre as well, so you can drink your juice or smoothie consuming all the vegetable and fruit; whereas a juicer will give you a lighter drink, but you will miss out on the fibre. Instead of having processed foods like cereal or rich foods like fried egg and buttered toast for breakfast, try to begin the day with a vegetable smoothie; it is filling, tasty, and won’t leave you feeling sluggish. Aim to drink at least two glasses each day, or go on a juice fast one day a week, consuming nothing but vegetable juice all day long. Most people find the thought of drinking a vegetable juice revolting; I did too until I tried it – it was delicious! Sweetened only with fruit, it was satisfying, filling and helped me achieve way more than the recommended five-a-day (often I was doing 12-a-day!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">3.</span> Go nuts – snack on nuts and seeds instead of crisps and biscuits and you will find that you never experience the midday energy drain that is common to most people. Make your own raw snacks that are super delicious and good for you and you’ll never reach for a candy bar again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Recipes to tempt</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #800080;"><em>The naughty: chocolate truffles</em></span><br />
• ¾ cup cocoa powder<br />
• 2 cups ground raw almonds<br />
• 1/2 cup honey<br />
• 1 tbsp organic coconut oil<br />
• Pinch of sea salt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mix ingredients into a bowl. Take small amounts and roll into balls. Freeze till firm. These can be served straight from the freezer and make great energy snacks. Feel free to experiment with other flavours and additions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><em>The nice: cucumber smoothie</em></span><br />
• 1 cucumber, peeled and chopped<br />
• 1 cup mint leaves<br />
• 4 cups fresh pineapple<br />
• 3 cups water<br />
• juice of ½ lemon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply blend all the ingredients together and enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A raw food journey may seem daunting, but like anything else in life, it only gets easier the more you try it. Make small changes and add to them as you gain in knowledge and confidence. Above all, do what works best for you in your quest for better health.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Manar Umm Travis is charmed at the sight of flowers floating in her teacup and invites us to take a sip.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next to water, tea is probably the most consumed beverage worldwide. And yet, I don’t believe most people venture into the possibilities of the distinctive taste and effects that teas can offer. I am hardly a tea connoisseur and yet, I enjoy the wide array that’s available &#8211; flavourful, fruity, unique, green, black, herbal, oolong, Chinese, Turkish &#8211; with sugar, honey, lemon, or milk. To me and for most people, tea is like a potion to invigorate our minds and bodies before a busy day and also to unwind and relax at the end of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Growing up in Canada, my mother introduced me to the world of teas when I was very young. She gave me chamomile tea when I was unable to sleep, peppermint for a tummy ache, Earl Grey green for relaxation and invigoration and green tea for detoxification. As I grew older and the tea market expanded, I tried every kind of tea I could find. However, it was very recently that I discovered the pure beauty of loose-leaf tea compared to using teabags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a trip to Istanbul last Eid, we realised that even more popular than Turkish coffee was their tea that was served steaming from tulip shaped glasses. While shopping for bags, the shop owner offered us a choice of the uniquely flavoured black tea &#8211; chay &#8211; or their other famous apple tea. I took only one sip and fell in love with the fragrant glass of tantalizing chay. My next day’s itinerary was not to visit some famous tourist site, but to buy tea to take back home with me to Cairo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My chay quest took me to the famous spice bazaar in Istanbul. I was hunting for the loose black tea powder as well as the apple tea made from pure bits of the fruit. We came across one of those shops in a little nook, nestled between other intriguing stone buildings, set apart by the bins of spices and hanging arrangements of dried herbs. I stepped inside to the warm greeting of a very friendly elderly Turkish woman. We asked her for the chay which is served all around the city. While she was packing our tea purchase for us, I stumbled across a group of bins with delightful colours and scents. I had noticed the apple tea, made from little bits of dried apple but my heart really jumped out of my chest when I realised the assortment before me &#8211; there was cherry tea, strawberry tea, orange with peppermint and something called “Love Tea” – all enticing my senses from within the bins. I knew then that I wasn’t about to leave the shop with only black chay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in Cairo, I tried all my floral concoctions. I knew I was in love with them forever. Funny how I’ve always known that chamomile is a flower, yet having drunk chamomile tea from tea bags for so many years, I delighted at the sight of the actual flower in my cup. It most certainly was a tea lover’s dream come true and I truly regret not buying more while in Istanbul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not to despair, however. Cairo has an array of Attars &#8211; shops designed for the sole purpose of selling loose spices and herbs. They also sell many key chay ingredients like hibiscus, chamomile, rosehips, jasmine and many more if you need to create your own infusion of flower tea. The most aromatic and tantalizing flavours usually include berries, and the Turkish “love” tea was an eclectic mix of strawberry, cherry, orange and apple for a fruit explosion on your taste-buds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most convenient way to serve loose-leaf chay is in a teapot designed to hold the flavourful bits back when pouring. Let it sit at least five minute to maximise flavour. To heighten the floral experience for your guests, I suggest adding a few dried flowers either inside their tea cup or beside it, on a saucer. And everyone’s favourite eye tease is the chamomile flower tea with peppermint and orange &#8211; a zesty and tangy spin on the traditional white flower drink. I promise you, taking a sip of some lightly sweetened tea from your favourite mug will never be the same once you have had a flower in your cup.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Fatima Bheekoo-Shah reviews the much celebrated and acclaimed book, The Gaza Kitchen.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Written by Laila-Al Haddad and Maggie Schmitt | Published by Just World Books</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us know the food of Palestine well. Think olives, hummus, tahini, falafel and lashings of grass-green olive oil drizzled over everything. But reading <em>The Gaza Kitchen</em>, I was fascinated to learn that food from Gaza is much more than that. A tiny strip of land with 2,000,000 inhabitants cut off from the outside world by the Israeli army, the Gaza Strip is not what you would expect from a gastronomic hot spot. Yet this is the account given by authors Laila Al-Haddad and Maggie Schmitt in their cookbook. I firmly believe that behind every recipe there is a story, and this book is just that. Part memoir, part cultural history, part political statement and part cookbook, it delights and educates on a multitude of levels.  For this reason, this book is fast becoming one of my favourites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laila El-Haddad and Maggie Schmitt set out to prove that Gazan cuisine can hold its own against any cuisine of the world, by making their way into the homes of Gazan cooks and documenting the recipes they make for their families every day. It’s a cuisine with some recognisable elements like chopped vegetable salads, falafel and richly spiced rice dishes &#8211; but this tiny region surprised me with its unique trademarks. Gazan cuisine is unique even within Palestinian cooking for its chillies, its red tahini (made with roasted sesame seeds), its use of dill seeds, and of course, the fact that all this is done under difficult circumstances and food shortages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Food authority and writer, Nancy Harmon Jenkins, writes the foreword for <em>Gaza Kitchen</em>. Interestingly, she notes that Gaza was once an important station on the spice route and the link between Southern Arabia and the Mediterranean. Spices from the land of the East continue to shape the cuisine of the culture today. Nancy believes that this book is a living legacy of traditional dishes from all over historic Palestine; a legacy of the refugees who flocked there after being driven out of their homes and farms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While most cookbooks will allure you with its glossy “picture perfect” food photographs, you will be drawn to this book because of the history written between the pages and the wonderful warm Gazan citizens that you meet along the way. Like the warm Fatema Qadam, a widow clad in a bright orange dress who enthralls readers with her narrative of owning a business rearing rabbits. Her rabbit farm is flourishing and Fatema shares an interesting recipe for fatta bil jaj or fatta bil aranib, which is a buttery rice dish served with griddled bread and stuffed chicken or rabbit. We also met the Gazan fisherman, which really struck a chord with me. The fishermen believe if it were not for the shimmering blue horizon of the Mediterranean Sea, Gaza might feel like a dungeon. The fishermen have an intimate relationship with the sea which spans generations and makes for the magnificent seafood and mouthwatering recipes that Gaza is well known for. The fish brothers &#8211; Iyad and Ziyad who introduced fish farming to the strip share a recipe for hbari maqli, a Gazan style fried calamari that had my guest clamouring for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I honestly don’t think any book review would do justice to this rich and inspiring book. While its main focus is on food and recipes, the book makes a political statement by showing the world the resilience and tenacity of the people of Gaza. At the same time, it is refreshing to get a new angle on the city, a human perspective.  The book beautifully illustrates many of the ongoing issues in the Gaza Strip: the struggles of local farmers and fisherman, reliance on the tunnel system for basic necessities and the difference between what is available and what is affordable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though Laila Al-Haddad is a former Gaza citizen herself, <em>The Gaza Kitchen</em> is not about her recipes. When it comes to the women portrayed in the book, the authors largely step out of the way and allow the women of Gaza to present their own stories and recipes. The weaving of these narratives in and out of the recipes movingly highlights the role of cooking and the home in Gaza and portrays narratives of food and family that will resonate with almost anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This book will make your mouth water, awaken your senses to something new yet old and perhaps leave you with a tear or two.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Cream Cheese Sticks</strong></span><br />
<em>“Impress your guests with this golden, crispy cheese snack that is both quick and easy to make and is great served with tea or soup. Make an interesting presentation on your table by placing a group of these sticks in a fancy glass and fanning them out next to a dip, or by tying a few of them up together with a colourful ribbon. Oh, and they taste even better the next day!”</em> &#8211; Nadia</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
• 1 cup plain flour<br />
• ½ cup softened butter<br />
• 110 gram cream cheese at room temperature<br />
• 1 egg, beaten lightly<br />
• pinch of salt<br />
• pinch of cayenne pepper powder, optional sesame and cumin seeds for sprinkling</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Preheat the oven to 175°C. This must be done before you begin preparing the flour mixture as the sticks will not get crispy if it sits before cooking.<br />
2. Line a baking tray with parchment paper or foil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In a bowl, add the plain flour, butter, cream cheese, cayenne pepper and salt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Combine these ingredients together by hand until you form nice dough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. On a well-floured surface, roll the dough into about ¼ inch thick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Cut the dough into even strips with a regular knife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Gently lay the strips on the baking tray, and brush them lightly with the beaten egg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Sprinkle sesame and cumin seeds on top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Bake for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Take out, let them cool and serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Cheese Tikka</strong></span><br />
<em>“Paneer, unlike most cheese, is very low in fat and does not melt on cooking. This property along with its great texture makes it ideal for pan-top grilling or frying. I usually make and freeze the green paste that is used here for marinating, so it is conveniently on hand for making curries and sauce. You may use frozen or fresh cheese.”</em> &#8211; Huma</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"> <strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
• 2 cups paneer/cottage cheese, cubed<br />
• ¾ cup yoghurt<br />
• 4 tbsp green paste<br />
• ¼ tsp salt<br />
• 4 tbsp oil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>For the Green Paste</em></strong><br />
• 1 bunch coriander<br />
• 1 bunch mint<br />
• 8-10 green chillies<br />
• 1 garlic clove, large<br />
• Water</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Prepare the green paste by placing all ingredients in a food processor. Add just enough water and process to form a  smooth, thick paste.<br />
2. In a large bowl, add the yoghurt, salt and about 4 tablespoons of green paste or according to taste preference and mix until smooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Throw in the cheese cubes and mix well to coat them completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Cover and leave in the fridge to marinate for a couple of hours or overnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Heat a grill or fry pan. Lightly spray or drizzle oil on the surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. String the cheese cubes on wooden skewers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Arrange the skewers in the pan and grill on medium-low heat. Turn and let all sides turn light gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Serve warm along with ketchup or chilli sauce as a snack or side dish to a main meal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Penne with Four-Cheese Sauce</strong></em></span><br />
<em>“I like to think of pasta with four-cheese sauce as mac and cheese for grownups. It takes a little more time and effort to make than regular mac and cheese but it makes an impressive entree on dinner table and is totally worth the time. This recipe includes a special type of cheese called Fontina and is a must in this dish. It is a great melting cheese and provides a wonderful cream base and flavour to this recipe. </em><em>This dish doesn’t do too well when reheated so it is best prepared fresh and relished as soon as possible.”</em> &#8211; Kanika</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
• 1 tbsp butter<br />
• 3 garlic cloves, minced<br />
• 2 tbsp plain flour<br />
• 1 cup light cream<br />
• 1 cup milk<br />
• 1 cup Fontina cheese, shredded<br />
• 1 cup Provolone cheese, shredded<br />
• ½ cup Mozzarella cheese, shredded<br />
• ½ cup Parmesan cheese, grated<br />
• ½ tsp salt<br />
• ¼ tsp ground pepper<br />
• 4 servings hot cooked penne or other pasta such as rotini</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. In a large, non-stick saucepan melt the butter over a moderate heat. Add the garlic and cook until soft.<br />
2. Stir in the flour and cook for about one minute or until bubbly. Remove the pan from heat and gradually whisk in the cream and milk. Return the saucepan to a moderate heat and cook, stirring often, until the sauce just boils and thickens, about three to five minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add the cheeses, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly until the cheeses melt and the sauce is smooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Transfer the cooked pasta to a heated serving bowl. Pour the cheese sauce over it and toss to mix well. Serve immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Lemon Curd Cheesecake</strong></span><br />
<em>“This deliciously tangy cake is adapted from The Australian Women’s Weekly Cheesecakes, Pavlovas and Trifles. This recipe makes is sufficient for a party of about ten people.”</em> &#8211; Aminah</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
<em>For the cheesecake</em><br />
• 250g plain sweet biscuits (such as digestives)<br />
• 125g butter, melted<br />
• 3 tbsp golden syrup<br />
• 3 x 250g tubs cream cheese (such as Philadelphia)<br />
• 110g caster sugar<br />
• 2 tsp finely grated lemon rind<br />
• 3 eggs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>For the lemon curd</em></strong><br />
• 45g butter<br />
• 110g caster sugar<br />
• 1 egg, beaten lightly and strained<br />
• 1 tsp finely grated lemon rind<br />
• 2 tbsp lemon juice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Process or crush the biscuits until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the butter, process until just combined. Add the golden syrup, mix well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Press the crumbed mixture into your chosen, well-greased tin (springform is ideal) or ovenproof dish, coating the base and sides evenly. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Preheat the oven to 170 °C. Beat the cheese, sugar and rind in a large bowl with an electric mixer till smooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Beat in the eggs, one at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Pour the mixture into the tin on top of the chilled crumb base. (If using a springform tin, place the tin on a baking tray before putting in the oven.) Bake in the oven for one hour or until set. Take out and leave to cool at room temperature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Prepare the lemon curd by combining all the ingredients in a medium heatproof bowl. Place the bowl over a medium saucepan of simmering water. Cook, stirring continuously, for about 20 minutes or until the mixture coats the back of a spoon. Remove the bowl from the saucepan to prevent further cooking, and cool to room temperature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Spread the top of the cheesecake with the lemon curd. Refrigerate for three hours or overnight. Remove from the springform tin just before serving; otherwise leave to serve in the dish.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up, I didn’t have very many Muslim friends. That’s why I was excited to start university; I was finally able to join the Muslim Student Association (MSA) and make friends with people who didn’t think I was weird for not drinking or dating, or any of the other haram things I tried to avoid. On campus, there were always sisters to talk to and hang out with in between classes and I never missed a prayer because we always prayed in jama’ah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It felt great to fit in for once and, other than classes, my life on campus revolved around the MSA. I began to develop a stronger Muslim identity, so much so that I found it difficult to relate to non-Muslims at all. Why would I need to talk to non-Muslims, I wondered; haven’t I always been told that good companionship is crucial to faith? I have my MSA friends and that’s all I need, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I began my fourth year of university, I realised how wrong I had been. For many of the students in my classes, I was the first Muslim they had ever known. And for some people, my hijab was intimidating. As Muslims, we can’t hide in our bubbles and expect people to change their opinion about us. I realised that I didn’t know how to interact with non-Muslims and non-Muslims didn’t know how to interact with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is when I met one of my good friends, Ana, who comes from a Latin-American background. Her open-mindedness, kindness, respect and curiosity helped transform my perspective about on-campus involvement. We clicked instantly and I was excited and flattered to answer any and every question she had about Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our conversations about Islam, pop culture, careers and culture, we both realised that we have more in common than we thought.  Our love of food was another thing that brought us together. While talking about my love for Mexican food, Ana came up with a brilliant idea of one day owning a Mexican-Pakistani fusion restaurant together as a tribute to our friendship and to the many similarities that our cultures share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This fusion dish is one of my favourite lunch recipes. The process to make tandoori chicken can be lengthy so I keep cooked tandoori chicken in my fridge on hand. You can use boneless or bone-in chicken, but remember to only use the meat for the quesadillas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This recipe is delicious because it has a classic quesadilla taste but with a spicy kick, and can be served with guacamole, chutney, chips, and samosas &#8211; really, it can go with anything!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><em><strong>Ingredients:</strong></em></span><br />
<strong>Tandoori chicken</strong><br />
900 g chicken, cut into pieces<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
1 lemon, juiced<br />
1 ¼ cups plain yoghurt<br />
½ onion, finely chopped<br />
1 clove garlic, minced<br />
1 tsp fresh ginger root, grated<br />
2 tsp garam masala<br />
1 tsp cayenne pepper<br />
1 tsp yellow food colouring<br />
1 tsp red food colouring</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quesadillas</strong><br />
1 cup Monterey Jack cheese, shredded<br />
1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded<br />
4 large flour tortillas<br />
Tandoori chicken, shredded<br />
2 tbs fresh cilantro, coarsely chopped</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #800000;">Method:</span></em></strong><br />
1. Remove the skin from the chicken pieces, and cut slits into them lengthwise. Place in a shallow dish. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and lemon juice. Set aside for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. In a medium-sized bowl, combine yoghurt, onion, garlic, ginger, garam masala and cayenne pepper. Mix until smooth. Stir in yellow and red food colouring and spread the yoghurt mixture over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Cook the marinated chicken on the grill until it is no longer pink and its juices run clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Combine the cheeses in a medium bowl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat for around 3 minutes. Place a tortilla in the pan and sprinkle with half of the chicken, half of the cilantro, and half of the cheese mixture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Top with a second tortilla and cook until the underside of the bottom tortilla is golden brown in several spots and half of the cheese is melted, or 3 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Using a spatula, carefully flip the quesadilla over and cook until the underside of the second tortilla is crisp and golden brown in several spots and all of the cheese is melted &#8211; about 2 to 3 minutes more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Slide the quesadilla from the pan onto a cutting board and cut into wedges. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make a second quesadilla. Serve topped with guacamole, salsa and sour cream, if desired.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ayshabibi Hafesji encourages us to experiment with turmeric.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turmeric is a powdery, bright yellow spice, initially made from a root plant found in the ginger family. It has a very bitter taste but a vibrant yellow-orange colour. Turmeric originates from India and China has been used for many, many years as a culinary spice, food preservative, herbal remedy and a colouring agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it is mostly used in curries, don’t be afraid to use it for medicinal and beauty purposes as well. Studies have now found turmeric to have powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, which help to combat various health problems. It is so commonly used that it has been nicknamed the aspirin of India and is found in every Indian family’s first aid kit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nutritionally, turmeric is rich in fibre, iron, potassium, manganese and vitamin B6. However, the main ingredient that causes its beneficial properties is curcumin, which has been found to be a great immunity booster. It is also used in various drugs and medicines, so we know that it helps the body against some illnesses:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>• Asthma and peptic ulcers by protecting the gastrointestinal lining: </strong></span><br />
Mix 1 tsp of turmeric powder in a cup of warm milk and drink three times a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #ffcc00;"> <strong>• Sore throats: </strong></span><br />
Mix ½ tsp of turmeric and ½ tsp of salt in a glass of warm water and gargle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>• Wounds and cuts: </strong></span><br />
Turmeric is also a great antiseptic &#8211; simply apply directly on wounds and cuts to stop blood flow and reduce the risk of infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turmeric is not only best used as a healing agent but for many beauty treatments too. For many generations, women in South Asia have used turmeric in their daily skincare regimes. Due to the bright yellow pigment and its powerful chemical properties, turmeric is used in some facials and skincare products. It helps to clear up blemishes, acne, dark spots and hyperpigmentation, as well as brightening up the skin to give it a healthy glow. Simply mix equal portions of turmeric and gram flour, make a paste with water or milk and apply to the face or body. Leave for 10-15 minutes and wash off with warm water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To treat oily skin, mix turmeric with sandalwood and orange juice. Apply to the face, wait for it to dry and wash off with warm water. Your skin will be left looking cleansed and dewy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some women, facial hair can be a real battle; we are always trying to find new ways to remove those unwanted hairs. Now you can try to reduce its growth with turmeric. Make a paste with water and apply to the face either every day or on alternate days to see the difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when you have a cut or need a refreshing facial, try out the bright yellow powder which doesn’t need to be restricted to your cooking, but can be used for your health and beauty too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four of the &#8220;Superfoods&#8221; mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Hadith-the date, olive, pomegranate, and fig-are some of the earliest cultivated foods dating back thousands of years. They have played a pivotal role in the lives of many peoples and hold special significance in many cultures and traditions. Read on to discover these incredible foods and some of their unique qualities.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a tree among the trees which is similar to a Muslim (in goodness), and that is the date palm tree.&#8221; <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Sahih Bukhari)</span></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many, the month of Ramadan is the only time of the year dates are consumed. This is a real shame because dates are packed with nutrients and have numerous potential health benefits, including protecting against certain cancers and other serious diseases. They can be eaten fresh, dry, ripe, or unripe. The Prophet (SAW) is reported to have eaten dates with butter, cucumbers, bread, and on their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dates are mainly carbohydrate (70- 80%), most of which is the type of sugar that is easily absorbed by the human body. An average portion of 100 g of dates (approximately 6 to 7) provides about 11 to 15 percent of the total daily energy requirement for adults.</p>

<p>Dates also are low in sodium and fat, and rich in fibre, minerals, and antioxidants. Dates contain at least 6 vitamins (including several B vitamins), several organic acids, and a higher amount of protein than other fruits. Dates also are high in potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, and are a good source of iron, copper, and manganese.</p>

<p>Dietary fibre in dates (and other foods) is extremely important for several reasons. It helps with the treatment of diabetes and obesity, and is believed to protect against hypertension, coronary heart disease, cholesterol, colorectal and prostate cancers, and intestinal disorders. Fibre also helps with weight control and the functioning of the large intestine. It acts like a sponge by soaking up water and swelling in size, which makes you feel full. The Prophet (?) is reported to have said that &#8220;A family which has dates will not be hungry.&#8221; (Sahih Muslim). Fibre also helps to speed material through the large intestine, thus reducing constipation. Consuming only 6 or 7 dates each day provides the average adult with 50-100 percent of the recommended daily amount of fibre. No wonder some researchers have described dates as &#8220;an almost ideal food&#8221;!</p>

<p>The pomegranate is a spherical, orange-sized fruit with a tough, leathery rind. Inside are hundreds of seeds surrounded by a translucent red, pink, or whitish sac full of juice. The juice comprises about 30 percent of the fruit&#8217;s weight. There are about 63-78 calories in 100 g (3.5 oz) of the fresh juice sacs. The juice is high in antioxidants and potassium, as well as a good source of vitamin C, pyridoxine (vitamin B-6), and pantothenic acid (vitamin B-5). It is also low in sodium and has no fat or cholesterol. Notably, pomegranate juice has more antioxidant activity than green tea.</p>

<p>The fig is unique as it is a flower blossoming inside itself. The seeds are what we eat. Interestingly, the Chinese character for fig means &#8220;fruit without a flower.&#8221;<br />
Figs are often eaten whole and raw but can be peeled. While they are less well-known in the West than the other Super Foods of the Sunnah, figs are becoming more popular, especially as an ingredient in health food snacks. Figs are similar to dates in their nutritional and beneficial health effects. They are low in sodium, fat and cholesterol- free, and an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, including calcium, potassium, iron, thiamin (B-1), and riboflavin (B-2). Figs also are extremely high in fibre and antioxidants, potentially helping to protect against many cancers. Like pomegranates, figs have higher antioxidant activity than green tea.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Fatima Bheekoo-Shah shares a delicious snack recipe for a healthier alternative to your regular fried bhajis.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The low carb, high fat lifestyle has taken South Africa by storm and with it there has been an influx of healthy and tasty foods. This bhaji recipe is one of them &#8211; it is the perfect snack. These morsels are fried in coconut oil, which has a range of health benefits including increasing your energy expenditure and helping you burn fat. In some parts of the world, coconut is a dietary staple that people have thrived on for many generations. One interesting feature of coconut oil is that it can reduce your hunger. This may be related to the way the fatty acids in it are metabolised, because ketone bodies can have an appetite reducing effect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Courgettes are one of the very low calorie vegetables, with only 17 calories per 100g. They contain no saturated fats or cholesterol. Its peel is a good source of dietary fibre that helps reduce constipation and offers some protection against colon cancers. You definitely can’t go wrong with this recipe! It is simple and nutritious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
• 1 large onion, finely chopped<br />
• 2 courgettes, grated<br />
• 1 tbsp of your favourite curry powder mix<br />
• 1 clove garlic, crushed<br />
• 1 tsp fresh coriander or Italian flat leaf parsley, chopped<br />
• 1 tsp Himalayan salt<br />
• 2 tsp psyllium husks (available at health food shops)<br />
• 2 large free-range eggs<br />
• 1 cup coconut oil for frying</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. Combine all the ingredients except the coconut oil in a bowl and stir until well combined<br />
2. Set aside for 10-15 minutes<br />
3. Melt the coconut oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry dollops of the mixture in batches until crispy and golden<br />
4. Drain on paper towel to remove excess oil.<br />
5. Serve bhajis piping hot with a dipping sauce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Variations </em><br />
• Add freshly chopped red or green chillies if you like that extra bite.</p>
<p>• Roughly chopped cauliflower and grated carrots are also a great substitute for the courgettes.</p>
<p>• To keep it interesting, I add less salt or no salt and add some roughly chopped feta or haloumi cheese instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Learn about the correct ingredient ratios for salad dressings with this article by Yvonne Maffei.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been making salad dressing at home for more years than I can remember buying them in stores. It all started when I left home for college and really wanted to taste the same kind of dressing my mom made that went with our greens for all of our Italian dinners. She used to buy a packet of seasoning that came with a nice glass shaker with indented markers on the glass that instructed how much oil, vinegar and water to add to the bottle. In an effort to save every penny I could while in college, I decided I would attempt to make the dressing myself by figuring out the right flavour profile and the ratio of oil to vinegar that was necessary to recapture that very same salad dressing I loved so much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although a relative ratio of oil to vinegar is important to know, don’t be afraid to try making your own recipes just because you don’t have exact amounts. The best way to tell if a dressing is right is by taste! You can shake it up and taste as you go, then adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few more tips before you embark on making your own dressings, which I highly recommend. It’s healthier, more economical than most quality store-bought dressings and so easy to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vinaigrette is a classic type of dressing in which the ratio of oil to vinegar is 3 to 1. As the name indicates, there is typically a certain type of vinegar in the recipe or at least an acidic ingredient (i.e. lemon, lime or orange juice) to offset the oil. Experiment with different flavours of vinegar such as date, raspberry, balsamic, white balsamic and apple cider vinegar. Some are stronger than others, so it’s best to jot down how each type works in your homemade recipe so you don’t have to keep wondering what you did to make that perfect dressing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To thicken a dressing, add honey, egg yolk (only from the freshest eggs) and mustard. This does affect the 3:1 ration slightly, so remember to take note.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bring all ingredients to room temperature before starting, as oil is difficult to work with when it’s cold and can also throw off the measurement since it is more fluid when warmer. Avoid using aluminum bowls when making vinaigrette, as the acid in the vinegar can react with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go ahead and add herbs and spices to your dressing, but just make sure that when using fresh herbs you’ll also use up that dressing quickly as they can deteriorate quickly; if you plan to keep your dressing for a while, use dried herbs and spices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use high quality oils for all dressings as they tend to add flavour instead of an ‘oiliness’ you don’t want on all of your greens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When making creamy dressings, be sure to use full fat cream or dairy products, as they tend to separate less than the low fat and fat free versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you can try one of my favourite homemade salad dressings at home with this recipe for a classic Italian vinaigrette.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #deb510;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar<br />
1 cup extra virgin olive oil<br />
2 tsp honey<br />
Pinch of sea salt<br />
Dash of freshly ground black pepper<br />
1 tsp dried parsley</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #deb510;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
In a small but deep bowl, add the vinegar then whisk in the oil gently. Add the honey and continue to whisk. Add the salt, pepper and parsley. Pour the mixture into a bottle for serving the vinaigrette and let sit for 1-2 hours for the flavours to settle in together nicely. Shake well before serving atop your favourite salad greens.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In the latest installment of Musings of a Foodie, Fatima Bheekoo-Shah chats about her favourite meal of the day.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have all heard the saying that breakfast is the most important meal of day. It is also my favourite meal of the day. I have to admit in my younger years I was never a morning person. I wanted silence and a good cup of Joe before I spoke a word to anyone. My husband changed that. He is very much a morning person and has this infectious way of being cheery and happy in the mornings that I would like to think has rubbed off on me over the years. There is just something about waking up to a new day, a new start and waking up to breakfast. I have a deep love and respect for breakfast. It helps wake up my brain, fuel my body and gets things started on the right note. Food, or the absence of it, is so closely linked to my mood that if I skip breakfast you might find me in tears by lunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, breakfast is also the most versatile meal of the day for me. There is so much one can do for breakfast. From muesli, porridge, yoghurt, fruit, muffins, eggs, pancakes and even leftover food from the night before. I am by no means a breakfast traditionalist though. While I can get down with all of the usual breakfast fare, I do not limit the first meal of the day to eggs, pancakes, granola or other breakfast-y things. I’ve been known to root through the fridge in the morning, dig out the remains of a rib eye steak or a bbq lamb chop and eat it cold off the bone. I tend to listen to my body and feed it what it wants, even if it gets weird. Go with your gut, right? And sometimes my gut tells me to break an egg in last night’s curry and mop that up with some crisp sourdough bread or leftover flat breads. And cake for breakfast is something I do eat on occasion and think is totally acceptable. However, I don’t do cereal, ever. I cannot understand how people can have boring old cereal most mornings. Even as a child I remember refusing to eat cereal. I suppose convenience and time plays a big factor for us in our stressed, fast paced and rushed lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While time may be a factor most weekdays, weekend breakfasts are meant to be leisurely and the later the better. That’s when I like taking my time and make a good egg fry up for the family with some pressed beef, mushrooms, tomatoes, spicy sausages and maybe some lovely baked beans. Then there is the toast; sometimes it is a commercial white loaf and other times a lovely crisp rye bread or a home-baked loaf. It has to be toasted to perfection, crisp but still retaining some of its softness &#8211; served with lashings of cold butter. For drinks, there is freshly squeezed orange juice and plunged coffee for the adults. I also lay some lovely fruit on a platter, served with luscious and creamy Greek yoghurt and if I manage to get up early enough, some lovely fresh muffins, crispy sweet French toast or even doughnuts.  Feeling relaxed. Eating something that is a little bit more special than your average run of the mill weekday breakfast. Putting a little bit more effort into the aesthetics of the meal. Bottomless coffee. Perhaps flowers on the table.  Being totally present in that moment, enjoying your food, not thinking too much about the worries of the day, not concerning yourself with your to-do list, phone and other technological devices off to the side. Breakfast time is always social. And let me tell you something, if you&#8217;ve had a really hard day and have come home wondering what you are going to cook, breakfast for dinner is an idea. What’s wrong with spreading the breakfast mood to the rest of the day?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0606;"><strong>Perfect French toast</strong></span><br />
<em>I am not sure if the French actually invented French toast but I am really glad Martha Stewart perfected it.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0606;"><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></span><br />
• 6 large eggs<br />
• 1 ½ cups milk<br />
• Juice of 1 medium orange (about 1/4 cup)<br />
• Seeds of one vanilla pod<br />
• 1 tbsp sugar<br />
• Zest of 1 lemon (about 1 tbsp)<br />
• ½ tsp ground cinnamon<br />
• Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg<br />
• Pinch of salt<br />
• 6 slices of bread such as brioche, sliced 1-inch thick, preferably a day old<br />
• 4 tbsp unsalted butter<br />
• 4 tbsp vegetable oil (I use coconut oil)<br />
• Pure maple syrup (optional)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #bf0606;"> <em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. Whisk together eggs, milk, juice, vanilla, sugar, zest, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a bowl; set aside.<br />
2. Place bread in a shallow baking dish large enough to hold bread slices in a single layer. Pour egg mixture over the bread; soak for 10 minutes. Turn slices over; soak 10 minutes more or until soaked through.<br />
3. Preheat oven to 200°C. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet and set aside.<br />
4. Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry half the bread slices until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.<br />
5. Transfer to wire rack; place along with baking sheet in oven while cooking remaining bread.<br />
6. Wipe skillet and repeat with remaining butter, oil and bread. Keep in oven until ready to serve.<br />
7. Serve warm with maple syrup, if desired.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hasina Ahmadi shares a delightful and popular vegetarian Afghan starter.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This shorwa (soup) is a refreshing and healthy vegetable soup that is great for summer dining. It is a simple and traditional Afghan dish, yet full of flavour and is served to guests on a regular basis. What I love about this soup is that you can choose from a variety of different  toppings and it will still be a simple, exotic and presentable dish. When guests arrive and families are gathered around, there is no better way of starting your meal. It is an easy soup to make so have a go and serve a big bowl of hearty, warming shorwa to your family members and guests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Add a little elegance to your fruit salad with this colourful fruit salad from Fatima Bheekoo-Shah.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years ago when I first trawled the Internet for recipes, I made a few friends on a site called Recipezaar. It was a place where you exchanged recipes and ideas and best of all, you made friends with foodies around the world. Through Recipezaar, I met a lady who called herself Zuri and was the author of a book that explored her childhood memories about food. Brought up on a farm outside of Stellenbosch, South Africa, Zuri soon left the beautiful farmlands for the city and was privileged to dine at some of the best restaurants in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zuri often said she judged the standard of a restaurant by the fruit salad on the menu. According to her, fruit salad is meant to be a blend of soft fruits &#8211; not hard, chewy ones &#8211; and they should be bite-sized and lay in a simple light sugar syrup &#8211; not be drowning in fruit juice. This has stuck with me when I make my own fruit salad. This recipe is simple and pairs well with thick, luscious Greek yoghurt. It is a firm favourite with the children in my home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc3000;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
<em>Fruit</em><br />
• 450 grams fresh strawberries, diced<br />
• 450 grams fresh pineapple, diced<br />
• 350 grams fresh blueberries<br />
• 350 grams red grapes, diced into halves<br />
• 4 kiwis, peeled and diced<br />
• 400 gram can mandarin oranges in juice, drained well and sliced into halves<br />
• 2 ripe bananas, diced</p>
<p><em>Honey Lime Dressing</em><br />
• ¼ cup honey (I use less as I am not fond of an overly sweet fruit salad)<br />
• 2 teaspoons lime zest (zest of 2 medium limes)<br />
• 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc3000;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. Add all fruit to a large mixing bowl<br />
2. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the honey, lime zest and lime juice<br />
3. Pour over fruit just before serving and toss to evenly coat. As it sits for a few minutes, the juices will gather at the bottom, so toss again before plating<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Notes:</em><br />
Instead of lime use the zest of oranges and a few drops of orange juice or orange blossom water for a Moroccan twist.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Fatima Bheekoo-Shah explores a nourishing chicken broth that will not only get rid of the sniffles, but heal your gut as well.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stock, or ‘broth’, is probably one of the most basic things you can make. In good restaurants there are simmering pots of it on the stove every day of the week. It is an ingredient in many recipes and can be added to stews and curries to make them even more nourishing. In traditional foods circles, you’ll hear a lot about broth, stock and bone broth &#8211; and they’re typically used interchangeably. Bone broth, broth and stock are built on the same basic foundation: water, meat or bones (or both), vegetables and seasonings. Bone broths are extraordinarily rich in nutrients &#8211; particularly minerals and amino acids. As it cooks, the liquid is typically skimmed, although this is not necessary since the scum that rises to the top of the stock pot &#8211; off-putting though it may be &#8211; is a rich source of amino acids. Eventually the solids are removed by straining the stock with a sieve or coffee filter. To increase the calcium of your broth, make sure you add the apple cider vinegar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong> Chicken Broth</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"> <strong> Ingredients</strong></span><br />
• 2 kg free range chicken<br />
• 3 medium onions, cut in half<br />
• 4 large carrots, trimmed and peeled<br />
• 1 root end of a whole celery stalk, 4 inches long<br />
• 2 bay leaves<br />
• 10 whole black peppercorns<br />
• 3 medium fresh tomatoes, cut in half<br />
• 1 cup parsley, stems only<br />
• A few sprigs of parsley<br />
• 2 tsp salt<br />
• 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (optional)<br />
• Cold water</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
Add all ingredients to a large stockpot and fill with cold water until ingredients are covered by 5 cm. Place over high heat until the water comes to a boil.<br />
Reduce heat to hold a medium simmer, and simmer for 3 hours. Use a large spoon to remove residue floating on surface. This residue is coagulated protein and will occur at first boil and decrease after you skim it for the first 15 minutes<br />
Pour the broth through a large fine strainer. Save the chicken and de-bone while it is still warm. Discard extracted vegetables.<br />
Taste the broth and adjust for salt. Refrigerate broth overnight. You can use the chicken for chicken soup or chicken salad.<br />
Use your broth in soups, stews and curries. A good homemade chicken broth gives you the foundation for making delicious soups and sauces and has a myriad of other uses. You can cook your grains and legumes in it for extra nutrition and taste. You can flavour stir fries, chicken pot pie, taco filling and many other dishes with it. Having chicken broth on hand gives you the ability to make some wonderful dishes easily. It is also a nourishing drink on its own.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Christine Amina Benlafquih goes in search of the benefits of one of the fruits mentioned in the Qur’an.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can’t recall ever tasting a fresh fig during my childhood, but like many American kids of my generation, I was quite fond of a packaged cookie called Fig Newtons. Tender cake-like pastries with a chewy fruit filling, they were, in my opinion, far better than Oreos and other mainstream treats which were probably more popular with my peers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years later, the thought of fig cookies doesn’t resonate well with my own kids, who wouldn’t know a Fig Newton from a date-filled mamoul. They do, however, know the unique texture and flavour of a dried fig, as well as the sublime pleasure of indulging in ripe, fresh figs barely off the tree before they make their way into our home. Soft, incredibly sweet and juicy, this wonderful creation of Allah (SWT) simply can’t be outshone by the man-made sweets and confections which it may inspire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Figs in the Qur’an</strong></span><br />
Figs are mentioned only once in the Holy Qur’an, but in a way in which Allah (SWT) compels us to contemplate the miraculous nature of this fruit: “<strong><em>By the Fig and the Olive…</em></strong>”<em><span style="color: #999999;">(At-Tin:1)</span>.</em> Adding further emphasis is the fact that this brief ayah is the opening line in a surah which bears the name of the fruit itself – “The Fig.” What is it about figs then, that makes them so worthy of our consideration? To explore this, we need to look beyond the ahadith, where the limited references to figs deal with the topics of trade and zakat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Health Benefits of Figs</strong></span><br />
More than 600 years ago, Ibn Qayyim noted in The Prophetic Medicine that fresh figs are extremely nourishing, with the capability of cleansing the kidney and bladder and reducing toxins in urine. Dried figs in turn, he wrote, are beneficial to the nervous system and when consumed on an empty stomach with nuts, helpful in opening the alimentary tract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only does modern science substantiate the fact that figs contain nutrients which offer the detox benefits mentioned by Ibn Qayyim, but it also confirms that the fibre, vitamins and minerals in figs do indeed contribute to overall health, including optimal functioning of the digestive and nervous systems as well as the eyes, kidneys and lungs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies have shown figs to be a fruit which is notably high in antioxidants, dietary fibre (both soluble and insoluble) and essential fatty acids which help maintain healthy cholesterol levels. Figs are an excellent source of B vitamins as well as vitamins A, C, E and K.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are high in the minerals phosphorus, potassium, manganese, magnesium and iron. The extremely high sugar content (more than 50 percent) in figs makes them an excellent choice for restoring energy, particularly for athletes and those suffering from prolonged illness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Figs in Traditional Medicine</strong></span><br />
In traditional medicine, figs have been used as a tonic and internal cleanser and to treat a variety of ailments including colds, sore throats, coughs and other respiratory conditions, digestive problems, constipation, kidney and urinary tract infections, skin conditions and wounds, weak sexual strength and even mental illness. They are believed to be useful in treating rheumatism, diabetes and stomach ulcers and the high potassium in figs has been proven helpful in keeping blood pressure down. Likewise, a high fibre intake has been shown to reduce men’s risk of heart attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why not, then, incorporate these powerhouse fruits into our diets?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Honey-Fried Figs</strong></span><br />
<em> Serves 2 to 4</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This easy dessert recipe combines the exceptional health benefits and good flavour of two sunnah foods – honey and figs. Serve the figs plain or with a dollop of sour cream or ice cream. Or, offer the figs as a garnish over cakes, ice cream or a bowl of fresh berries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></span><br />
• 4 fresh figs, cut in half lengthwise<br />
• 4 tablespoons butter<br />
• 4 tablespoons honey<br />
• Cloves, cinnamon or other spices (optional)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong><em>Method</em></strong></span><br />
1. Melt the butter with the honey in a skillet over medium heat. If desired, add sweet, aromatic spices such as clove or cinnamon to taste.<br />
2. When the butter-honey syrup is bubbling, add the figs, cut-side down. Reduce the heat a bit and cook the figs until the bottoms are slightly brown and caramelised-looking. Remove from the heat and serve warm.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making your own granola is simple and much more economical than the store-bought versions. What’s nice about it, too, is that you can substitute the type of nuts and berries for those that are in season or local to you to make it even easier on your budget. Add the granola to warm milk for a hearty cereal in the morning or put it in small storage containers to take with you as a snack when you travel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Yields approximately four cups.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #b00000;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />

• ½ cup mix of raisins and dried cranberries<br />

• 1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />
• 1 ¼ tsp salt<br />
• ¼ cup grapeseed oil<br />
• ½ cup clover honey<br />
• ½ cup raw cane sugar<br />
• 1 ½ tsp alcohol-free vanilla extract</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b00000;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Preheat oven to 160°C/325°F.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Combine oats with dried fruits and nuts. Toss this with cinnamon and salt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In a separate bowl, stir together the honey, sugar and grapeseed oil. Add the oats mixture to this and mix all together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and pour out the mixture onto the paper.  Spread it out evenly with a spatula or the back of a large spoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Bake for 15-17 minutes.  Remove and allow let cool before storing in a tight-fitting glass jar. Keeps fresh for about one week.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This fragrant soup recipe from Clara McQuaid packs a good dose of fibre and is sure to please even the pickiest family member.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Autumn is the perfect time to start serving up soups again. This makes a great lunch, but if the family have had a substantial lunch it can also make a comforting supper served up with lots of fresh crusty bread. Sweet potatoes are full of goodness and flavour and the coconut milk adds a luxurious creamy base to this soup. You can make it up to 2-3 days in advance and keep it covered in the fridge. You can freeze it for up to a month, but blitz it with a hand blender upon defrosting as it may split.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serves 4-6<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
• 450g sweet potatoes, cut into cubes<br />
• 2 tbsp sunflower oil<br />
• 1 onion, finely chopped<br />
• 1 leek, trimmed and finely chopped<br />
• 1 lemongrass stalk, trimmed and halved<br />
• 1 red chilli, halved, seeded and thinly sliced<br />
• 1 tsp freshly grated root ginger<br />
• 1.25l of vegetable or chicken stock<br />
• 4 tsp tomato puree<br />
• 400g tin of coconut milk<br />
• Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />
• Chilli oil to garnish (optional)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC. Place the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet, drizzle over 1 tbsp of the sunflower oil and roast for 20-30 minutes until tender. Set aside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Heat the remaining oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the onion, leek, lemongrass, half the chilli and ginger and sweat for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the roasted sweet potato with the stock and tomato puree, then bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes until the liquid has slightly reduced and all the vegetables are tender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Pour the coconut milk into the pan, reserving about 3 tablespoons from the top of the tin as a garnish, and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Season to taste. Remove the lemongrass stalk and blend with a hand blender until smooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. To serve, ladle the soup into warmed bowls and swirl in the reserved coconut milk. Add a drizzle of chilli oil and sprinkle the reserved chilli slices over the top.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #c79736;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
• 200g brown sugar<br />
• 200g butter<br />
• 1 tbsp golden syrup<br />
• 300g plain flour<br />
• Drop of vanilla<br />
• 1 tsp bicarbonate soda<br />
• 200g bar chocolate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c79736;"><em><strong>Method</strong> </em></span><br />
Preheat the oven to 180˚C. Line 2 large baking trays with parchment paper.<br />
Cream the butter, sugar and syrup together.<br />
Sift the flour and bicarbonate of soda together in a large bowl. Add to the butter and sugar mixture along with the vanilla and mix well into a dough.<br />
Make about 15 ping pong ball size balls from the dough and push chunks of the chocolate into each ball.<br />
Place the balls on the baking sheets and press down gently with the palm of your hand. Make sure they are well separated as they will spread while cooking. Bake for 12- 15 minutes, until they are golden brown.<br />
Put on a wire rack to cool.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Raw food enthusiast, Tabassum Siddiqui, explains why we should all be embracing 'living food'.  ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you wake up  in the morning feeling groggy and congested even after 8 hours of sleep? Do  you have a brain fog after eating? Can’t seem to concentrate? Feeling low on energy all the time? Are you unable to explain your unpredictable mood swings? Do you have trouble maintaining your ideal weight? Are you suffering from any diseases or sicknesses that the doctors have told you that you just have to live with? Do you feel that you have lost the vibrancy of your youth?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If you have said yes to any or all of these questions know that you are just one of billions of people that are suffering from an overly toxified body. Our modern diet and lifestyle are the root causes of all of our sicknesses, diseases, and psychological problems. With the advent of processed foods, our polluted environment, toxic household products, chemical grooming products, radiation from mobile phones, televisions and microwave ovens, it is no wonder we are bloated, emotional, irrational, medically obese, full of uncontrollable vices, and, in many cases now, suffering from terminal illness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"> <strong>It’s in the food </strong></span><br />
Whenever we cook our food, we kill all of the living force in our fruits and vegetables. When we heat anything over 115º, we basically eliminate practically all of the water, nutrients, enzymes, and minerals that these fruits and vegetables have to offer. What is eliminated through heavy cooking is the real nutrition that our bodies need to make healthy new cells in our body and carry out repair on a daily basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A high consumption of cooked food, laden with hormones, antibiotics, chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, preservatives, artificial colors and flavours, fats, gluten, and salt has filled our bodies with an enormous amount of toxins and mucus. This leaves our bodies unable to heal themselves or cope with this heavy onslaught. If food is the fuel that runs our body, then what type of fuel are we putting into our mouths? What type of output do we want? Do we want to eat a heavy dinner to be later left feeling sluggish, unable to even make ‘Isha salat? Or do we want to eat the fresh, vibrant, ready-to-eat foods that Allah I has provided us with to leave us feeling comfortably full, nourished, and full of positive energy and lightness?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Eating for healing </strong></span><br />
I used to suffer from anxiety attacks that left me petrified, with heart attack-like symptoms and insomnia. I was taking the strongest prescription available to tranquilise me. This unfortunately led to a dangerous addiction. But that was the only thing that doctors could provide me with: I could live my life as if I were asleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, through adopting a raw foods lifestyle, I have cured myself of severe asthma, allergies, depression, and severe anxiety, alhamdulillah. Through changes I have made in my diet and lifestyle, my condition has disappeared. I also no longer find myself in the emergency room because I can’t breathe due to one of my frequent asthma attacks. Now I only carry my inhaler around with me as a reminder of what my life used to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meals packed with energy, nutrients, and proteins, made with organic fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds lead to optimum health: a clear mind, heart, and spirit as well as restored youth and beauty. Eating a diet based on raw, living foods boasts curative benefits and allows the body to cure itself from everything from fourth stage cancer to multiple sclerosis, asthma, paralysis, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now more than ever, we need to get back to the fitrah and uncomplicate our bodies, lives,and food. Make the first steps towards a better life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the right way to start off your day or to end your evening. This juice is a powerhouse of vitamins, nutrients, minerals, enzymes, protein, and just 100% pure energy. We drink this every morning and we don’t feel hungry until lunch. Trade in your fried eggs, toast, cereal, breakfast bars, coffee, tea, and bagels with cream cheese for a true elixir that your body will thank you for. And don’t worry whether the kids will like it; many mums have given this the “kids’ seal of approval”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t be surprised by the quantities. Once you start drinking this daily, your body will be wanting more. Feel free to substitute the fruits listed here if they aren’t available, but the greens are the base, especially the kale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;">Juicer version: </span></strong></em><br />
2 medium apples (peeled if not organic)<br />
1 orange<br />
3 carrots<br />
3 celery sticks (tops included)<br />
handful of parsley or cilantro<br />
handful of spinach<br />
handful of lettuce or other organic salad mix<br />
3 big  dark green kale leaves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wash all veggies and fruit. Chop into pieces that will pass through the juicer easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Juice fruits and veggies alternating the fruits with the leafy veggies so that all with pass through easily. Serve in a tall glass and enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Smoothie version: </strong></em></span><br />
handful of spinach<br />
handful of lettuce or other organic salad mix<br />
2 big  dark green kale leaves<br />
1 apple<br />
1 ripe banana<br />
a couple of dates or a couple of spoonfuls of date syrup<br />
8 oz. purified water<br />
spoonful of raw almond butter (optional)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blend all ingredients until smooth. Add more water to thin it out if needed or add more dates or date syrup to sweeten it. Serve in a tall glass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>DATE SYRUP  </strong></span><br />
<em>Makes one 8-11 oz. jar of syrup</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A replacement for white sugar, date syrup can be used in your smoothies and desserts. Other healthy sugar alternatives are 100% organic honey, stevia, and Agave syrup. For sweetening your hot beverages or in desserts that require a silky consistency, the clear, honey-like appearance and neutral sweet taste of organic Agave syrup is best.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this instalment, Fatima Bheekoo-Shah explores how some recipes have beautiful stories behind them.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not sure if people still keep handwritten recipe books. I was born in 1978: that means I lived a good portion of my formative years in the presence of crimped hair, no hijab fashion, shoulder pads and recipe books. My fascination with recipe books started in my teenage years, when I would spend hours paging through my mother’s handwritten recipe notebook. She started the recipe book when she got married and each recipe had the date and also the name of the person who gave her the recipe. She would also neatly clip out recipes she found in the newspaper and carefully paste them in her notebook. Over the years, the pages have become discoloured and have oil and water splotches on them, yet it has not lost its charm. It is like my mom recorded a little bit of history in those pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides her handwritten recipe book, my mother has a collection of cookbooks that includes the <em>Australian Women’s Weekly</em> series and some Indian cookbooks.  I can recall days when I needed to find the perfect chocolate cake recipe and I had to flick through ten cookbooks till I found just the right one. There were times when I wanted a light airy sponge chocolate cake and there were times when only a rich, dark, moist chocolate cake with a hint of coffee would do.  These days, I can simply Google it and come up immediately with the right recipe via the Internet. But you know what? I still love cookbooks. I still find myself buying new cookbooks. I often console myself with the fact that while most women collect shoes, I collect recipes and cookbooks. I tell myself that you can never have enough cookbooks, and yes I really do need the latest Nigel Slater cookbook. It might just contain a new recipe for potato salad that I don’t yet have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My collection includes books by various chefs and food writers, clippings from newspapers, binders full of printed recipes from the Internet, food magazines and even food-related novels.  A few years ago we decided to renovate the kitchen and my husband insisted that we allocate some space to bookshelves to house my many cookbooks. I think he was tired of finding them all over the house. Little does he know that as my collection grows, the shelves have proven too few and presently some of my cookbooks occupy the shelves in his study as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, my regular morning ritual consists of nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee while paging through my various cookbooks hoping that a recipe will inspire me so I can answer the age-old adage, “What do I cook for dinner tonight?” While I have many books, I seem to always gravitate towards the same ones over and over. One in particular is <em>Indian Delights</em> by Zuleikha Mayet, first published in 1961. The book stands proudly alongside my Jamie Oliver, Yotam Ottolenghi and Heston Blumenthal cookbooks. The book &#8211; a wedding present from my dad &#8211; has great sentimental value. Additionally, the book also contains a wide array of traditional South African Indian dishes. Through most of my adult life, this book has been my go-to for traditional and authentic menu ideas from India. It’s an artistically produced book, with historical photos and information about food. However, my absolute favourite part of the book is the little anecdotes the author has scattered between the various pages. Often when I am making roti (unleavened bread) I think of this story about a couple that lived during the Moghul Empire. The story is titled <em>How a Lady serves her Prince Charming</em>. Theirs was a tranquil home with little stress and no upheavals. Each day, after the couple performed their evening prayers, the prince would proceed to take a leisurely stroll in their gardens. In the meantime, his lady prepared to lay out his dinner on a brass platter. Leisurely strolling over, he would arrive to enjoy his two hot curries, jug of iced water, pickles and a solitary piping hot roti on the side plate. On the other half of the table, the lady is busy rolling out another roti, meanwhile checking and turning the one that is half done on the grilling plate. This way she replenished his roti plate with as many hot rotis as his massive appetite required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This story brings all sort of vivid images in my head. I imagine the setting and the ambience and I wonder what two curries this Prince Charming was served every evening. While times have changed and our lives have become rushed and noisy, it still all culminates in a comfortable silence at suppertime when families reconnect, just like the lady and her Prince Charming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me a recipe is not just a recipe. It tells a story, sometimes of a time long ago. The preparation of food, like culture and tradition, is passed down from one generation to the next &#8211; not just recipes, there’s always a story behind it too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b88954;"><strong>Indian Delights Roti Recipe</strong></span><br />
The secret to soft flaky roti is boiling water. My children love roti and while I fry them off to accompany a curry they slowly take them hot off the plate, smear them with butter and jam and gobble them up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b88954;"><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></span><br />
• 400 g all purpose flour<br />
• ½ tsp salt<br />
• 2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil<br />
• 1 cup boiled water<br />
• 3 tbsp ghee or melted butter<br />
• ½ cup flour for dusting the work surface</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b88954;"><strong><em>Method</em></strong></span><br />
1. Add 350g flour into a mixing bowl. Add the oil and the hot water. Mix with a tablespoon avoiding using your hands since the dough will be quite hot with the boiling water.</p>
<p>2. Take some of the remaining flour and dust the worktop. Remove the dough from your dish and place on the worktop.</p>
<p>3. If it is sticky, add a little flour until it is soft and manageable. Knead the dough until a soft, smooth, pliable dough is formed. This could take up to 5 minutes. Like most bread, the key to soft bread is a dough that is well kneaded!</p>
<p>4. Roll the dough into a large circle. Take the melted butter or ghee then spread over the dough.<br />
5. Then roll the dough like a Swiss roll. Roll inward toward you. Once you have formed a snake-like shape, cut into even pieces.</p>
<p>6. Take one of the cut pieces, stand upright then press down with your hand &#8211; this will create a circle when flattened. Dust your hands with flour and work this small circle into a  slightly larger circle, then place onto work top and roll into a flat round disc.</p>
<p>7. To cook your soft roti simply place on the preheated pan (the pan should be very hot). The cooking process for each roti should be 1 minute. Allow the roti to cook for 5-10 seconds before turning it over. On the second side, allow to cook for a little longer, pressing the sides with your finger or spatula to ensure that it cooks. Once the roti rises or you see bubbles form, turn the roti using a spatula. Do this twice over on both sides.</p>
<p>8. Once you can see golden brown spots, the roti is cooked. Remove from the stove, then repeat this process for all the remaining roti. Once all are cooked, cover with a paper towel or dishcloth; this will keep the moisture in, keeping the roti soft until you are ready to serve them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #b88e4f;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color: #b88e4f;"> <em>Loaf</em></span><br />
• 225 g self-raising flour<br />
• 225 g light muscovado sugar<br />
• ½ tsp salt<br />
• 225 ml groundnut oil<br />
• 4 medium eggs, separated<br />
• 50 ml espresso or strong filter coffee, cooled<br />
• 50 ml milk<br />
• 75 g chopped walnuts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #b88e4f;"> <em>Espresso Cream Filling</em></span><br />
• 250 g mascarpone<br />
• 1 tbs espresso<br />
• 25 g golden syrup<br />
• 10 g icing sugar, sifted</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b88e4f;"><em>Icing</em></span><br />
100 g icing sugar, sifted<br />
1 tbs espresso coffee<br />
6-8 walnut halves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b88e4f;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. Preheat oven to 190°C. Butter a 22cm loaf tin.</p>
<p>2. Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a large bowl. Add the oil, egg yolks, espresso and milk and beat until smooth, either with a hand mixer or a wooden spoon.<br />
3. Whisk the egg whites until stiff (definitely use an electric hand mixer, unless you are brave). Fold them into the mixture in two batches.</p>
<p>4. Stir in the walnuts and add the mix to the cake tin. Smooth over the top. Bake for about 50-55 minutes. Leave the cake to cool in the tin for a while before tipping it onto a wire rack.</p>
<p>5. Now make the espresso cream. Spoon the mascarpone into a bowl, beat the coffee in, then the syrup and the icing sugar until well combined.</p>
<p>6. Split the cake into 3 layers with a large bread knife. Spread the espresso cream over the two bottom layers and sandwich together.</p>
<p>7. To make the icing, blend the icing sugar and the coffee together and drizzle down the centre of the cake, smoothing it towards the sides using a palette knife. Don’t worry about completely covering the surface. If it drips over the edges then all the better!</p>
<p>8. Decorate the top with the walnut halves and dust with a little icing sugar. Leave the cake to set for about an hour before eating.</p>
