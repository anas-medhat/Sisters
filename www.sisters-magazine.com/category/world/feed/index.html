]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Written by Melati Lum | Reviewed by Papatia Feauxzar | Published by Melby Rose Publishing</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Ayesha Dean &#8211; The Istanbul Intrigue</i> is the first young adult novel written by Melati Lum. She is an Australian, Malay, Chinese, Muslim Lawyer who has worked as a Crown Prosecutor, prosecuting serious criminal offences in the courts. Melati Lum has previously worked for the United Nations in the Hague in the prosecution of war crimes that occurred in the former Yugoslavia. She currently lives in Adelaide, Australia with her family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In this book, Ayesha Dean is a fairly new eighteen-year-old high school graduate who is travelling to Turkey with her two friends, Sara and Jess, along with Sara’s father, Mr. Isa, and Ayesha’s uncle/legal guardian, Dave. Sara’s father and Dave are business partners attending a legal conference in Istanbul and they invited the girls with them on this trip. Ayesha Dean is your cool and hip Muslim chick who is knowledgeable in martial arts, dresses chic, and is a firm believer. Her courageous and detective sides also show from the first pages of this young adult book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Once in Turkey, after Ayesha, Sara, and Jess freshen up a bit, they start their tour of Istanbul at the legendary Grand Bazaar. The mystery starts after hours of buying souvenirs, trying their hand at bargaining, and combing the multitude of stalls at the bazaar where they come across of an old book shop. Looking for a present for her uncle David, Ayesha spots the perfect gift in that book bazaar: an antique book of maps. The shop owner, Mehmet, is pleasant and he introduces Ayesha to his handsome son Emre; a character I want to read more of in the future series, insha Allah. Emre shows the girls around town and while they are on a sightseeing break, Ayesha takes a closer look at her uncle’s gift and realizes that it hides a mysterious note that she decides she needs to uncover with her love and keen sense of mysteries. This leads her and her friends on a path of excitement and meetings with dangerous treasure seekers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The novel has a multitude of interesting characters and some of which make you infer that there is always more than meet the eyes with anybody, such as you have the character that judges people on appearance and you have the character whose looks make them look guilty… Overall, <i>Ayesha Dean &#8211; The Istanbul Intrigue</i> is very original and reminiscent of Nancy Drew’s series and mysteries. That said, the book also has roots in Ibn Arabi’s (The Greatest Shaykh) works. Melati Lum was able to create a very gripping Muslim fiction teen book with sound knowledge masha Allah. The teen in me really loved it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<i>Ayesha Dean &#8211; The Istanbul Intrigue</i> is not preachy at all. It has sprinkles of Arabic words that are very common knowledge these days like the word <i>hijab</i>. The plot is not religion based but about clues and crime solving. I recommend it to anyone who wants to travel to Turkey without having to buy a ticket to go there. I also recommend it to your teens readers and the children in you alike. I can’t wait to read the next tome in the series insha Allah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Exotic words from old, half-forgotten books, natural ephemera and memories - Humayrah Bint Altaf unravels her love for these to Az]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Olde Sewing Room, somewhere in Bedfordshire, England. Light filters in but leaves some corners dark. Piles of books, boxes of lace, scatterings of feathers and pebbles and leaves, all quietly clamour for space. Mary, aloof in all her mannequin splendour, looks on with unseen eyes as Humayrah Bint Altaf weaves memories into skeins of gold thread and lets her needle gently pierce through fabric, in and out, in and out, leaving stories in the stitches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3563" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5.jpg" alt="img5" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least, that’s the picture my mind pieces together from the images and words that Humayrah shares with me. She tells me how what began as a foray into the world of fashion design quickly became a detour back to an old love &#8211; embroidery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I began embroidering at the age of 14 after seeing my grandma lovingly make crocheted gifts for friends and family,” says Humayrah. “I have fond memories of spending my school holidays in her home. The duck egg blue walls, hand-dyed silk saris that neatly lined her wardrobe, even the soft floral scent of her saris are still fresh in my mind. It was here that my heart became entwined in needlework and all things handmade.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humayrah says she believes that everyone is on a personal journey to Allah (SWT), and hers began while studying fashion at the University for the Creative Arts in Surrey. By the time she was in her second year there, she became discouraged by the competitiveness of the industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The constant expectation to imitate and embrace the forever changing trends on the catwalk left me feeling like I was losing my identity as a Muslimah. After much patience and prayer, I was blessed with the opportunity to study hand embroidery at the Royal School of Needlework in Hampton Court Palace. In my two years there, I developed my skills in traditional hand embroidery techniques like goldwork and silk shading, and my love and appreciation for exquisite craftsmanship blossomed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3562" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img3.jpg" alt="img3" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img3-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img3.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her work seems to weave together the old with the new. “My grandparents’ belongings; lost, old objects, letters from loved ones, leaves and twigs I stumble across on evening walks, all touch me. The chiffon scarves my grandma used to crochet for me, her kohl applicator, her laces and trims; her rusty, steel scissors are all very dear to me. Alhamdulillah, I am able to find poetry wherever I look, but trying to detach myself from constantly feeling an attachment to material things is a personal struggle of mine. The very nature of this Dunya is transient, and it can sometimes feel absurd to tie yourself so tightly to things that were never meant to last. I somehow disagree with collecting just for the sake of collecting, but I strive to transform old things and make them live and be loved again.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Humayrah’s world, even the inanimate has personality. She names her embroidered pieces after people, and her mannequin may as well be her kindred soul. “One way I choose to &#8216;live&#8217; with old pieces is by naming them. Mary, my mannequin, is a fine example. Named after my love for Mary Poppins and Mary my &#8216;English name&#8217; for times when my colleagues couldn&#8217;t pronounce Humayrah. Having a mannequin is quite like having a sister, but Mary always understands and never ruins your clothes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the pictures she shares on Instagram and her listings in her Etsy store, it is easy to see that Humayrah is greatly inspired by the natural world. I ask her about where she lives, the sights and sounds she encounters, the feelings she carries back and how it all informs her work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Who is a better crafter than Allah? The influence of His natural creation is something that is woven throughout much of my work. I&#8217;ve always loved discovering beautiful things and enjoy wandering through the woods near my home, where I gather leaves, twigs, feathers and other ephemera to bring back home and preserve. I also like to incorporate the treasures I find into my embroideries and with each piece, I feel that a part of me has been embedded into my work. My favourite embroidery technique has to be goldwork because of the way the metal threads vary in colour when seen in different lights and from different angles.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3560" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img1.jpg" alt="img1" width="640" height="637" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And amongst all this are the words. Words woven into thread, exuding spirituality. “I am a &#8216;word collector&#8217;. Unusual words with wondrous meanings fascinate me. My favourite word at the moment is sonder. John Koeng describes this noun in his Dictionary Of Obscure Sorrows &#8211; “The realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own &#8211; populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness &#8211; an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words should be celebrated, says Humayrah. “Take kawaakari for example &#8211; a Japanese word meaning the gleam of last light on a river&#8217;s surface at dusk; the glow of a river in the darkness. I feel there is a spiritual mystery hidden in the folds of language, and it&#8217;s important to hem these extraordinary blessings with thankfulness. An ayah that I find incredibly stirring is when The Most High says: &#8230;A goodly word is like a goodly tree, whose roots are firmly fixed and its branches reach to the heaven&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Whenever I imagine Paradise, I imagine casting my eyes upon a magnificent library of some sort. Intricate leather etchings on golden bindings are scattered all over my sewing room. I find comfort in discovering links between past and present, and the nostalgic aroma of old books.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3561" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2.jpg" alt="img2" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s one particular book that peeks through several photos that Humayrah shares online. “The Girleen by Edith Johnstone is a cherished vintage novel I discovered on one of my weekly visits to boot sales. It has the most perfect handwritten note that always touches me &#8211; &#8216;Dorothy Bwidkin, Edale Day School, 1910 Prize for attendance.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There are times when I stitch words into weathered pages &#8211; emotions, experiences, sometimes wishes. This is something quite personal that I haven&#8217;t shared with others yet. I guess stitching words into these pieces means that their story and mine have become intertwined, like a journal really &#8211; another reason I have become attached to books. Often, the connection between words and embroidery is not apparent to anyone except me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And her atmospheric photography &#8211; is that by chance or by design? “I believe in storytelling through imagery, the comforting effect a word or photograph may have on people. A single image with a few concise words woven together is enough to whisk me away and lead me to create a certain composition. I try to keep my work room, The Olde Sewing Room, looking as atmospheric as possible, helping me to &#8216;get in the zone&#8217; whilst embroidering and photographing. Often, happy accidents happen in The Olde Sewing Room through a mixture of disorder and serendipity. I have an obsession for dark, cluttered rooms thus parts of the Olde Sewing Room are dim and unlit but entirely filled to the brim with feathers, shells, broken twigs, bowls of beads, bundles of metallic threads, handcarved wooden printing blocks and lots of clocks! This is where I feel my most authentic, happiest self, especially as I am alongside Mary, my mannequin.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your needle, my child, and work at your pattern; it will come out a rose by and by. Life is like that &#8211; one stitch at a time taken patiently and the pattern will come out all right like the embroidery&#8221; &#8211; Oliver Wendell Holmes.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Cycling may be the greenest way to get around but, as Arwa Aburawa knows firsthand, cycling for many Muslimahs entails a myriad of]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I bought a bike as an adult, I did so when my mum was on holiday. I only cycled late at night so none of my neighbours would see me and practised in a park in the next town along. After my mother returned, I found one morning that my lovely red Rayleigh had been dismantled and the parts distributed to the local boys. One took the chain as a spare and the other made use of the wheels. You could say that my first foray into cycling hadn&#8217;t exactly gone smoothly, but I also wasn&#8217;t surprised. Even though I&#8217;ve lived in the UK all my life, I was told as a young girl that it wasn&#8217;t &#8216;appropriate&#8217; for a Muslim girl to cycle. Especially one who wore a hijab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, that didn&#8217;t stop me developing a deep fascination for bikes and cycling. As corny as this sounds, they became a symbol of freedom and liberation for me. My fascination only grew when I became involved in environmental campaigning where the bike is hailed as the ultimate green and healthy form of transport. Cycling is cheap, it keeps you healthy and happy and produces absolutely zilch carbon emissions, unlike cars or even buses and trains. So why wasn&#8217;t I cycling? Not an easy question to answer, especially to my cycling friends who didn&#8217;t really understand the cultural barriers that I, and many Muslim women who want to cycle, face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
And it is cultural barriers. Attitudes towards Muslimahs on bikes are diverse. Whilst it&#8217;s very much frowned upon in the Middle East, Algerians seem to have no issue with it &#8211; I have an Algerian friend whose dad insists she cycles even though she hates it. We both enjoy the irony of our situation. In some Asian countries, the sight of a Hijabi woman on a bike or moped doesn&#8217;t stir the slightest bit of interest. Indeed, I&#8217;ve always found it rather amusing that the humble bicycle could be seen as a threat to the &#8216;virtue&#8217; of Muslim women. Even after I&#8217;d cottoned on to the underlying reason to the objections raised by my mum when I was young, I still thought it was all a bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a lump of metal and wheels that happens to transport you from A to B!&#8221; I told my  mum. Yet cycling as a Muslim women is seen as subversive in the Middle Eastern culture from which I hail. Can all this fuss really be about my hymen? And yes, the hymen is what we are talking about, as it is, apparently, one and the same thing as being virtuous. Or is this about the fact that cycling makes you independent and self-sufficient? It&#8217;s free, you don&#8217;t need to pay for petrol or insurance, and you need nothing but your two legs to take you wherever you want to go &#8211; something which is particularly threatening if you happen to be single as well as female.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent award-winning film by Saudi Arabian director Haifaa Al Mansour called &#8216;Wadjda&#8217; tells the story of a young girl living in Riyadh who becomes obsessed with a green bike at her local store. She wants to race with the boy in her neighbourhood, but soon cultural pressure from her mother and father thwart her efforts to buy the bike. A Qur&#8217;an recitation competition with a cash prize is her last resort to acquiring her beloved green bike. &#8220;I remember when I was a kid, my father took me along with my brothers to get bicycles and I chose a green one,&#8221; explains Al Mansour who is the first female Saudi filmmaker. &#8220;I am extremely lucky to have a father who wanted me to feel dignified as a woman, but it was definitely a different story for my classmates and friends who would have never even dreamed of asking for a bicycle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the heart of the story [of the film] is something anyone can relate to, which is the idea of being labeled different or deviant for wanting something outside of what is traditionally considered acceptable,&#8221; continues Al Mansour. &#8220;The Saudi culture can be especially brutal and unforgiving to people who fall out of step with the society, so there is a real fear of being labeled an outcast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social and cultural pressure is at the heart of why many Muslim women are forbidden from cycling. It is not deemed as very lady-like and is also seen a threat to a girl&#8217;s reputation. I for one would like to challenge that. I recently decided that I would try cycling again, years after my first failed attempt. I went on a free adult cycling training course, got on the bike and was soon cycling around the park with a huge smile on my face. It was as liberating as I imagined it would be and let me tell you this: so much fun. I would certainly not be giving up my bike without a fight this time!</p>

<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Green Facts of Cycling</strong></span><br />
• Bicycles currently save over 238 million gallons of petrol every year<br />
• Riding for 15 minutes to and from work each day burns the equivalent of 11 pounds of fat a year<br />
• Bicycles cost less than 3% as much to purchase as a car<br />
• Like all exercising, cycling helps improve your health, your mood and lowers your blood pressure<br />
• It takes around ﬁve percent of the materials and energy used to make a car to build a bike<br />
• A bike produces zero pollution.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ J. Samia Mair looks at how we can raise our children in non-Muslim lands to be proud of their faith. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My children who live in the United States see and hear anti-Islamic statements or are the ‘beneficiaries’ of anti-Islamic policies on a regular basis &#8211; and I suspect that is the same for other children living in non-Muslim lands. They hear reports on the news, read inaccuracies in books, overhear an adult conversation, to list just a few examples. It is a fact of life and one that I do not believe parents can or should shelter them from &#8211; our children need to learn how to be proud Muslims in the midst of unfair criticisms and negative perceptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember when I was invited to speak at a conference sponsored by the CDC in Atlanta. I worked in public health at the time and it was the first time my colleagues there were going to see me in a hijab. I was dreading the trip as previous experience taught me that my new look had consequences, mostly negative. I had a mantra that I kept repeating to myself from the airport &#8211; to my hotel &#8211; on my walk to the lecture &#8211; as I approached the podium &#8211; and right before I began to speak, “I am a proud and beautiful Muslim woman. I am a proud and beautiful Muslim woman”. We have a right to be proud as Muslims. We have that right because our values and our system of norms are from Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an adult it is much easier to be Muslim among Islamophobes, to wear that hijab when you know what it represents to some people, to pray in the parking lot when people are staring, to bring your Qur’an on the airplane even though it may get you kicked off. But for our tweens and teens, that tender age of emotions, peer importance, and the desire to fit in makes it more difficult for many. So what do we do? I certainly am not an expert; my efforts are a continual work in progress &#8211; trials and errors, failures and successes, tears and joy. But what I have learned so far from my experience and the experience of other parents is the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Role modelling</strong></span><br />
If we want our children to feel blessed to be Muslim and unafraid to let the world know it, we had also better be. Children are copycats and if anyone sees behaviour or attitudes that she doesn’t like in her children, she should look to herself (and her husband) first. If you are afraid to pray in public when prayer time is running out, it is likely they will too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Peers</strong></span><br />
Muslim children need to hang out around other Muslim children. That doesn’t mean that they can’t have non-Muslim friends; it means they need close, practising Muslim friends to strengthen their deen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Knowledge of the deen</strong></span><br />
If they know their deen, they will be able to recognise the myriad of inaccuracies and outright lies about Islam that persist in an Islamophobic environment and more able to set others straight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Media awareness</strong></span><br />
The more they understand the media’s agenda and biases, the more they will not be affected by it and the more they will understand why other people are. My daughter has become a critic of the nightly news. She is learning to question the motives of the source of her information and to wonder what information she is not being told. She wants to hear about issues that concern her. She no longer listens to the news thinking that whatever is said is the truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>A sense of justice</strong></span><br />
“But that’s not fair” is something most parents have heard a lot. Children have a sense of justice, and throughout life they will face many things that don’t seem fair, including how they may be treated. Children need to learn what Islam says about ‘justice’, and understanding it in the context of Allah’s (SWT) will and <em>qadr</em> for a proper perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>A sense of humility</strong></span><br />
Being ‘proud’ does not mean that you feel superior to anyone. None of us knows what our end will be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Confidence</strong></span><br />
We all need confidence to speak out against something accepted by the majority or act in a manner not in sync with the secular norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Commitment on our part</strong></span><br />
A parent needs to be committed to creating an environment to counteract anti-Islamic influences. We might have to drive an hour once a week for a play date with a Muslim friend or to don the hijab around disapproving relatives or take classes ourselves so we can teach our children the deen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This looks like a long list and there are undoubtedly more that could be added to it. But as parents, we are doing these things anyway in other aspects of raising our children, whether it be helping them to succeed in school, promoting loving relationships with non-Muslim relatives, or driving them to a football game. These same efforts just need to be extended towards cultivating in our children a love of Islam such that no matter what anyone says, they are grateful to be Muslim and unafraid to make it known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>O Allah, unto You do I complain of my weakness, of my helplessness, and of my lowliness before men. O Most Merciful of the merciful, You are Lord of the weak. And You are my Lord. Into whose hands will You entrust me? Unto some far-off stranger who will ill-treat me? Or unto a foe whom You have empowered against me? I care not, so You have not wrath with me. But You favouring help &#8211; that were for me the broader way and the wider scope! I take refuge in the light of Your countenance whereby all darknesses are illuminated and the things of this world and the next are rightly ordered, lest You make descend Your anger upon me, or lest Your wrath beset me. Yet is it Yours to reproach until You are well pleased. There is no power and no might except through You.</em> (Du’a the Prophet (SAW) made after being rejected and wounded in Ta’if)</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paris, capital of love and romance, is often seen as a museum-city, a beacon of classicism and high fashion. France, however, has a very long history with Islam, from al-Andalus which reached the south of the country to the disasters of colonialism, and today France is a multicultural society with the largest Muslim community in Europe. While it has often been a conflictual relationship, France is a country deeply influenced by its Maghrebi and African communities: the French’s favourite dish is Moroccan couscous! An estimated five million Muslims live in France, contributing to every aspect of social, cultural and political life. Paris is a relatively small city with a good transport system, and it is easy to walk everywhere here. One word of warning though: the metro system is not wheelchair friendly, and it is difficult to access with prams, so make sure to take a baby carrier or a foldable stroller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #48c3f0;"><strong>What to see</strong></span><br />
Beyond Paris’s popular tourists spots such as the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower, there is plenty to do for couples and families. True, Parisians are not famous for being particularly welcoming, but the beauty of the city largely makes up for it. There is something to suit all tastes, with a large number of museums, halal restaurants, shopping galleries, markets and parks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barbès, in the North of Paris, is considered the North African area, with countless little cafés to enjoy a glass of fresh mint tea and almond delicacies, but it is in fact the Latin Quarter that historically hosted Arab immigrants. The Paris Grand mosque (metro stop: Place Monge), built in 1926 to thank Muslim soldiers who fought alongside France against Germany, is a little peaceful oasis with its gorgeous courtyards, and it has its own café and traditional hammam (Pro tip: you might be asked for an entrance fee as tourists are allowed in parts of the mosque. Do not pay! Say you are coming in to pray).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After prayers, walk down towards the Seine and visit the Arab World Institute (IMA) on the riverside, where they organise various events and exhibitions about Arab culture, including crafts and storytelling for children. Pop up to their terrace on the top floor and enjoy the panoramic views of Notre-Dame. When you leave, have a look at the local Arab bookshops, such as Librairie Avicenne which holds a wide collection of Islamic books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paris has a large number of museums and it would be a shame not to visit a few if you have time. The recently opened Institute of Islamic Cultures in Barbès is worth a visit: they exhibit young Muslim artists, and they even organise workshops in zellige and mosaic making, iftar cooking, poetry and much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Louvre has a lesser known but extensive department of Islamic art, comprising a large selection of objects from Spain to South Asia. Two more destinations for art lovers: the Quai Branly museum, next to the Eiffel Tower, is a fascinating space collecting artefacts from a large variety of cultures, and it is very family friendly. The Maison Rouge museum (metro stop Bastille) is a relatively unknown space showing emerging artists, perfect as an alternative to the very touristy Pompidou museum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a bit of fresh air, head to Jardin des Plantes or Jardin du Luxembourg, two favourite spots for Parisians: these are the perfect spots for a lazy afternoon of reading and enjoying the manicured gardens. Both have playgrounds for children, and the Jardin des Plantes also has a small zoo, one of the oldest in the world. There is a larger zoo in Parc de Vincennes, recently refurbished with five large biozones reproducing animals’ native environments. This is a fun way to introduce children to the variety of Allah’s (SWT) creation!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a long day out, have a walk around the Ile St Louis on the river Seine and get an ice cream from the famous Berthillon. Continue your stroll along the riverside, particularly enjoyable in the summer. Alternatively, walk up the stairs to the Sacré-Coeur Basilica in Montmartre, where you can enjoy the most breathtaking views over the city and visit one of the prettiest areas of the city, once famous for its painters and artists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A trip to Paris necessarily includes a shopping stop; why not plan your holiday during the sales season and bag a few bargains? The Printemps Haussman (metro Havre Caumartin) is a large department store where you will find everything you need. Le Bon Marché (metro Sèvres Babylone) is smaller, but also includes a food hall for foodies! For a more original experience, visit one of the many flea markets (the biggest one is St Ouen, metro Garibaldi) and browse the antiques. In addition, every April the Bourget Muslim fair is organised, the biggest event for Muslims in the country with dozens of exhibitors. Favourite brands amongst French Muslim ladies include Misstoura, Ines à Paris and Fringadine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #48c3f0;"><strong>Where to eat</strong></span><br />
There’s a huge range of halal restaurants available, including ones selling gourmet French cuisine such as Les Enfants Terribles (metro Parmentier) and Le Jumeyrah (metro Rue St Maur), which are well worth a visit for a local culinary experience, while being halal. Other popular restaurants include La Troika Libanaise (metro Charles Michel) or Moroccan Atlas Couscous (metro Alesia). Please note, the large majority of ‘halal’ restaurants in Paris serve alcohol; I have tried to include the few that don’t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cafés and takeaway shops selling kebab, Lebanese falafel or Tunisian spicy tuna sandwiches for a quick snack are pretty much everywhere, particularly in Muslim areas. For those of you with a sweet tooth, there are also a number of famous North African bakeries serving delicious delicacies: Algerian brand La bague de Kenza has a number of shops throughout the city and is worth a trip. Tunisian La Rose de Tunis sells pistachio baklava and date makroud that are to die for. To finish, learn French Patisserie at the newly opened Halal cooking school (metro Cadet) and make your own macarons!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #48c3f0;"><strong>Where to pray</strong></span><br />
Apart from the Grand Mosque, most masaajid are located in the North East of the city, in the areas of Barbès or Belleville/Couronnes. Many are small and don’t have sisters’ facilities; the ones that do are: Omar mosque (metro Parmentier), Khalid Ibn Walid mosque (metro Chateau-Rouge), Abou Baker Assidiq mosque (metro Couronnes). There are also larger mosques just outside of Paris in Evry, Créteil and Clichy, amongst others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #48c3f0;"><strong>Beyond Paris</strong></span><br />
If you are feeling adventurous, head outside of the city to the Versailles Castle, a popular tourist spot, and why not pass through Disneyland in Marne-La-Vallée for a memorable family day out. There is no need to say any more about these two iconic attractions, so this is just a reminder that both are great outings for a day away from the city. Fontainebleau Forest is further afield, but easily accessible from Paris, and it will delight nature lovers. It is a very large, protected reserve particularly known for rock climbing and perfect for little explorers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope to see you soon in Paris, insha Allah!<br />

<p>As the flight touches down at Carthage airport, our party of three disembarks. My heart skips a beat as we pass through Passport Control but we are soon enveloped into the arms of my husband&#8217;s waiting family. We are in Tunisia, and my husband is home at last. His family welcomes home a son, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, and comrade after close to 20 years in exile. The joyful ululation of the women gives voice to an elation that cannot be expressed in words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>The heady fragrance of the Jasmine Revolution, which finally rid Tunisia of its crippling authoritarian rule on the 14th of January 2011, captured us in its folds and carried us from the southern tip of Africa to the shores of my husband’s homeland &#8211; Tunisia.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recapture the moment of reunion, of hearts bursting with joy, is impossible. Knees sank to the ground, prostrating with gratitude. My husband held the faces of his elderly parents, met his sisters who were now mothers, smiled in the eyes of his beloved brothers, and embraced his comrades, released from years of imprisonment or like him, exile. Songs of freedom wiped away the grief as smiling hearts sang of hope and victory. With tears of happiness wet on our cheeks, we left the airport for my husband&#8217;s family home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>Sitting in the car, the voices of my sister-in-law and niece, thanking and praising the Creator, accompanied us as we made our way to the town where my husband lived, the town he fled in February 1992, when his politics earned him exile. My husband asked to stop briefly at a river which runs along the town border. He stared out at the murky waters and remarked that the river had grown smaller. I wanted to tell him “No, it’s you who has grown bigger.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honking cars marked our arrival in his hometown and like a bridal party, we meandered through the streets, greeted by people waving and smiling at the return of a son. Every day during that first week was filled with such sweet memories and meetings. These hot but happy days and nights lasted until the early morning as family, friends and neighbours streamed in. At the end of this first week I was also treated to a second wedding, complete with all the paraphernalia which accompanies a new bride. Well, except that I had a three-year-old in tow who watched with fascination and approval as his mother was transformed into a bride. After all, we had come to Tunisia in the wedding season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One week after our arrival in Tunisia, I entered my in-laws home, a white safsari cocooning me from head-to-toe. Among the singing women, I fluttered out from beneath this shift, and like a butterfly, spent a beautiful evening with amazing women whose love, warmth, and smiles adorned my wedding party. I had visited the Turkish bath or hammam with my sisters-in-laws two days earlier, sitting for hours as my hands and feet were decorated with henna, and I braved the drive to the dressmaker’s shop where I was dolled up for the occasion. I marvelled at the women’s songs which spoke of patience and sacrifice, of love and happiness, and of the promise of Paradise. The beat of the duff lasted well into the night. The violet and gold wedding gown was exquisite; and seated at my side on the dais was my son, holding my jasmine-scented bouquet. On a beautiful Friday evening, my husband and I celebrated our marriage Tunisian-style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 38">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The night thereafter, it was the men’s turn to rejoice. Friends and family arrived after the Maghrib prayer and the beautiful sounds of the Qur’an recitation, in the Warsh style still widely practiced in North Africa, electrified the night air. For Tunisians, a gathering of this nature was unheard of months before. Alhamdulillah, all this is changing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>For two weeks, we met family and friends, and I was beginning to adjust to the customary afternoon nap, the qayloolah, which was necessary to cope with the sweltering heat as well as the busy nights. At night, cool lemonade and delicious sweets, served on silver trays, were always at the ready. Children swarmed about, and my son was swept away by his cousins, playing and laughing for hours. The sheep which lived on the roof fascinated the children almost as much as the classical Arabic which both my son and I spoke. This soon changed as we became immersed in the life and language of Tunisia. As for Tunisian food, well that’s another story&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My adventurous eating habits helped me adjust easily to the spicy Tunisian cuisine, but my husband had somehow lost his taste (or stomach) for harissa and my son was not coping too well either. As the food went a bit lower on the Scoville scale, all was well again. The milky coffee and crusty bread dipped in olive oil at breakfast; fruits and vegetables which burst with flavour; and tomato-based dishes that defied my imagination, have altered my taste buds forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blue waters of the Mediterranean beckoned but a story which cannot go untold is that of my one sister-in-law who, like the rest of the family, had crept into my heart completely. She had been parted from her husband when she was in her twenties and her two children were aged one and three. When he was freed seventeen years later, she was in her forties. She was diagnosed with cancer a short while after his release, and is now, alhamdulillah, in remission. An elementary school teacher, she truly reflects the dignity and patience of so many of our Tunisian sisters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>The following week, we packed for the beach, and a small group of the family travelled ahead to the holiday house. Our two-hour journey to south-eastern Tunisia took us through acres of olive groves, small towns and villages, and on to the little coastal town of Tazarka where we were faced with the clean-up job of a lifetime. With brooms, mops and buckets of water, we started scrubbing layers of dust away. Under all that grime the house was a real beauty and best of all, the jasmine tree in the yard was in full bloom&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Arwa Aburawa caught up with Kristiane Backer to talk to her about why Islam's green teachings are important to her.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a young MTV reporter rubbing shoulders with the music industry&#8217;s biggest celebrities, Kristiane Backer was living the dream. She had it all &#8211; money, fame and success. She was invited to the most glamourous parties, she was recognised everywhere and was flying all around the world meeting famous rockstars. Yet she admits she felt a huge void in her life at the time. She felt lost and confused. She was desperate for a real connection and spiritual fulfilment. Following a chance encounter with the athlete Imran Khan, who encouraged her to challenge the stereotypes she held about Muslims, Kristiane began looking into Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kristiane Backer travelled to various Muslim countries, spoke to Muslims and fell in love with the simple and peaceful message of Islam and converted. Her public conversion to Islam, however, didn&#8217;t run smoothly. As well as ending her TV career and putting a strain on her relationship with her family, the press accused her of &#8216;losing the plot and supporting terrorism&#8217;. To help tackle this Islamophobia, Kristiane wrote <em>From MTV to Mecca &#8211; How Islam Inspired My Life</em>, and she now uses her media skills to promote the beauty and diversity of Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Arwa Aburawa: Your conversion to Islam occurred slowly over a three year period following a lot of reading, travelling and debating. Can you tell us how Islam&#8217;s green principles influenced you?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Kristiane Backer: I think part of what drew me to Islam was its teaching about preserving nature and being kind to animals. I was in Pakistan with Imran Khan [the famous Pakistani cricketer and politician] observing the way the shepherds cared for their animals and would bring them home at Maghrib time [sunset]. They were so close to nature in the countryside in Pakistan, and it&#8217;s probably the same in other places. When they have surplus, they share it with their neighbours, and they don&#8217;t think about giving their animals hormones so that they can mass produce and become rich and hoard things. That&#8217;s another important thing; to live in harmony with nature and not squeeze every last drop that we can, the way we do with animals. I observed it in Pakistan and it really appealed to me how people live in the countryside in harmony with their animals. And this is totally founded on Islam as those are the Islamic teachings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>AA: Was this the first time you had thought about environmental issues or was it just the first time you had thought about it in spiritual terms?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>KB: I think it started in Germany actually, when I was a child. Germany established the Green Party so it&#8217;s always been influential, and I&#8217;ve always loved nature. Even as a child, I went on holidays to farms, and I loved to spend time by the sea and being in nature. It also hurts when you see nature being destroyed around you. Of course, when I looked into Islamic teachings it was also founded on Islam. You hear so many sayings of the Prophet (SAW) about not wasting resources and in the Qur&#8217;an, it says God does not like the wasters. The Prophet also said not to waste water, even when you are next to a running stream when he explained about wudhu. There are so many references and so it&#8217;s inherent in our faith that we protect God&#8217;s creations. We are vicegerents of nature and have a duty to protect it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>AA: Despite these green principles in Islam, it is not always the case that Muslims are the most environmentally-friendly people. Do you think that this is a problem?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>KB: Yes. When I went to Qatar a couple of years ago, I was shocked as I saw all these skyscrapers lit up at night even though they are completely empty. It is so blatantly contradictory to God&#8217;s teachings and acting against what we need to do. You may have the resources now but it&#8217;s not just your resources, it&#8217;s for the whole world, and we all need to think about the future. We know we have an energy crisis with prices going up so it&#8217;s utterly selfish and disrespectful to our teachings and to Islam to act like that and to be such wasters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>AA: Over the last couple of years, there has been a growing awareness amongst Muslims about green issues, but change is clearly happening too slowly. What do you think Muslims need to do to address this?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>KB: There has been talk about environmental issues amongst Muslims and also plans to make Hajj green, but I think we need to teach this aspect of our faith. We need to bring our faith more into the modern context generally and talk about environmental issues and the environmental crisis and how our faith gives us all the answers. I think the world has lost its awareness of the sacred and the recognition that what is all around us is from God and therefore it belongs to God, so to just selfishly destroy everything with a short-term vision is just going to make it worse for future generations. I don&#8217;t know if Muslims are seeing that, especially in the Middle East, but perhaps Muslims in the West are actually seeing that link more clearly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember I once gave a talk about this issue and a couple of years later, a lady that was in the audience came to me and said “What you said about not wasting our resources really made sense.” She told me that since then, she&#8217;s taken small steps in her everyday life to save energy and think about the environment, which I thought was great. So I think it is a message that Muslims are open to, but it&#8217;s important to make the message manageable and give people practical steps they can take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong><em>AA: I completely agree that tackling issues like environmental degradation and climate change can be really overwhelming, and so empowering people with practical advice is really important. What are some of the practical steps you take in your everyday life?</em></strong></span></p>
<p>KB: Well, I always switch the lights off when I&#8217;m not using them, I recycle and make sure I only boil as much water as I need. Even when I stay at hotels and all the lights are left on, I make sure I switch them all off before I leave. I struggle to eat locally here in London as we don&#8217;t have farmers markets like we do in Germany. In the city we have lost our connection with nature which is a real shame. But all these things are part of our inner jihad really &#8211; our struggle to be the best person we can be. We strive in the way of God and so striving to protect the environment is part of our inner jihad.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been fascinated by Egypt since I was eight years old, and after finally completing all my studies I recently moved there. I wasn’t sure what the living standards would be like because that is not the focus of ‘Modern Egypt’ or ‘Islamic Egypt’ university classes, and especially hadn’t considered how green living would translate in the city I would live in, Cairo. Despite the first appearance of a developing nation with a new government just finding its footing, there are surprisingly hundreds of green projects run by NGOs and government programmes that are currently working, quite successfully, throughout Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The first time I noticed a local green initiative was while walking along the pavements in downtown Cairo. As the Maghrib adhan was called, the street lights began to illuminate my path. Alhamdulilah, for light-sensitive-solar-powered street lamps! While public solar-powered lights are still rare in most of the US, I soon noticed these not only in Cairo, but in most of Egypt’s cities such as Suez, Alexandria, Assiut and the like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Recycling</strong></span><br />
Green projects extend far beyond solar power in my new host country. In Zamalek, Cairo recycling bins line the pavements outside shops, embassies and gated communities. This trend was echoed in other Cairo neighbourhoods such as Maadi and Dokki. Was this something only for the elites or was this project truly planned to expand throughout Egypt? I tracked down the recycling centre to find out more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through an alleyway in the development of Zabaleen in the Mokattam Mountain near the outskirts of Assiut, there are teams of eight men that each work for one month (followed by two weeks off) sorting the majority of Egypt’s recycling. The team I spoke with sorted paper and cardboard. Other groups sort metal and glass. The final group sorts plastic and old electronics (although this final category is still under development). The staff says recycling is now available nationwide, but getting collection teams to bring it back to the sorting centres is a problem. This is extremely hard work. It takes three weeks to bring the recycling from the big cities; it must be sorted out of a rubbish centre, and then finally brought into the sorting centre of Zabaleen. Although they encourage self-sort prior to rubbish collection, the centres still sort the recycling, clean it and package it to be exported and processed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Wind farms</strong></span><br />
Green living in the ‘Mother of the World’ aka Egypt, is not just about recycling; it also boasts the largest wind turbine farm in Africa and the Middle East. The Zaafarana Wind Farm has over 700 wind turbines that provide over 20% of all of Egypt’s energy, according a 2013 report by the Egyptian Ministry of the Environment. The site produces 550 megawatts of power annually. The government has earmarked more than 8,000 square kilometers to continue to expand this wind farm. There is a second large farm called the Elsewedy Towers with 300 turbines that generate 240 megawatts of power. The Renewable Energy Authority (a joint comission by the Ministry of Electricity and the Ministry of the Environment) states that electricity from wind turbines makes up 37% of annual energy sources in Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Hydroelectricity</strong></span><br />
My curiosity expanded: What are the other major sources of Egyptian energy? Other sources originate from hydroelectricity from the Aswan High Dam, solar fields in the desert, and of course old-fashioned oil and gas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Aswan High Dam was completed in 1970 and although it remains controversial due to the cost benefit analysis, it has helped regulate plant growth, allowed for resettlement of entire communities and has made a huge energy impact on Egypt. With 12 generators at 175 megawatts and a total of 2.1 gigawatts, it has transformed the electrical grid of modern Egypt. When Aswan High Dam first hit peak production, it was responsible for more than 50% of Egyptian electricity production. It is also the number one reason many Egyptians first started to have electricity in their homes. This hydroelectricity has literally brought entire towns out of the dark and continues to brighten their communities as they transform into cities. The villages of Toshka became New Toshka City and High Dam City. This unplanned urbanisation and social development launched a new desire to educate and increased energy consumption. The hydroelectricity from the Aswan High Dam still provides Egypt with more than 15% of its annual electricity consumption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hydroelectricity has fascinated scientists in Egypt before in the 1920s due to exploration of the Qattara Depression. In 2010, renewed research to develop this project began. The Renewable energy Authority plans to launch this project in 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Solar fields</strong></span><br />
The first solar field built in Egypt is Kuraymat in Ain Sukhna Port (between the Zaafarana Wind Farm and Suez Canal Proper). Launched in 2007, it is a joint project proposed by the Ministry of Electricity, endorsed by the Ministry of the Environment and implemented by the Renewable Energy Authority. Kuraymat Solar Field is currently being managed by Orascom Construction who has partnered with Solar Millennium. Unlike the solar panels used to power the street lamps I admired, Kuraymat Solar Field uses parabolic trough technology. From a distance they look like waves cresting in the ocean. The similarities end there. These waves rotate to collect the optimum amount of sunlight. They also produce 150 megawatts of electric capacity &#8211; this means that this one portion of the field supplies nearly two million people with power. The combined total of energy provided to Egyptians by solar thermal electricity is nearing 20%, according to a 2014 report by the Ministry of Environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After wading through the research, I was exhausted but pleasantly surprised to discover approximately 72% of Egypt’s energy, specifically electricity, is from renewable resources!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>What locals do</strong></span><br />
I soon began to wonder about everyday, small scale ways Egyptians are bringing green living into their homes. Eco Egyptians is a group with 1000 members, with monthly meetups with an average of 20 participants who make furniture and household items out of discarded wood, tyres and bottles. Many group members either buy products from or work for companies and NGOs with green projects in Egypt. Some of the organisations tied to Eco Egyptians are: ECO Homes which launched a line of PVC Windows, Shutters and much more; Energy Wise with lighting and power solutions for everyday life; Dayma who conduct nature and preservation tours for environmental awareness and lastly icecairo (many members are very involved with this) is a social enterprise to help launch green businesses, and finally the construction of an earthship (ecologically and sustainable living space typically made primarily from recyclables and natural items) being considered to be built near the Science Museum in Alexandria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the future will hold for these projects. Will everyone have recycling bins, PVC furniture and live in earthships? Probably not, but could the economic and ecological benefits of green living help Egypt prosper? Insha Allah. Green living is already proven to be a lifestyle for many people living in Egypt.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arriving in a small Turkish town on a cold January night, my sister-in-law and I nervously waited outside the ladies’ guest house as we watched our husbands disappear into the night. Uncertain that there would be an answer to our knocks at this late hour; we anxiously anticipated what would eventually await us on the other side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would be spending the next ten days in Lefke, an inconspicuous town huddled below the Troodos Mountains and overlooking the majestic Mediterranean Sea in the North West of Cyprus. Notable for nothing more than the luscious oranges that grow here, it is actually this retreat which constantly draws in thousands of travellers from around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had travelled here with the intention of learning more about myself, drawing closer to the Creator and revitalising my faith. It would also be a personal challenge to live with complete strangers for ten days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2983" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_54096925web-1024x687.jpg" alt="shutterstock_54096925(web)" width="1024" height="687" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_54096925web-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_54096925web-768x515.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_54096925web-1024x687.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cocooned in layers of woollen blankets, I lay awake wondering how I would rise for fajr without the aid of the alarm on my mobile phone. So used to Western living, I was surprised when the sweet sound of the adhan awoke me the next morning. It truly was a heavenly call and better than the monotonous beeping of an alarm clock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witnessing the banquet of a breakfast on the first morning, I realised that I’d be carrying a few extra pounds of luggage home and not in my suitcase either. I didn’t mind. We weren’t just being fed food but love. It wasn’t just our bodies that were being nourished but our souls and I wanted to soak up as many blessings as I could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wholesome meals were prepared devotedly by Aunty Samiya, custodian of the guest house, early every day. Mealtimes always began (and ended) with Aunty Samiya or an elderly guest reciting a prayer as the women congregated in a circle, perched on chairs, settees, steps, or anything we could find as we would wait expectantly for the first delicious dish. We would sit shoulder to shoulder passing our plates down for reinforcements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2984" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_32957695web-1024x680.jpg" alt="shutterstock_32957695(web)" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_32957695web-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_32957695web-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_32957695web-1024x680.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always wondered at the patience and generosity of the women who served in the guest house. Day after day they cooked, cleaned and fed an endless number of visitors. Back home after a weekend of entertaining, I could be found lying on the sofa exhausted crying, ‘no more guests for another six months!’ I wanted to be more like them &#8211; more generous, more hospitable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ladies’ guest house (there is a separate guest house for men) provides free accommodation and meals but all visitors are expected to help with everyday chores. I pitched in but, slightly averse to chores, I did feel like I should be doing more especially when my new friend advised me that ‘for every pot you scrub in the guest house, something is scrubbed off your heart.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would go for daily walks after dhuhr prayers, our senses shocked by the abundance of orange, lime, lemon and olive trees in bloom in this Cypriot town in the peak of winter. In contrast, the UK was covered in a blanket of snow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time moved slowly. There was nowhere to rush off to and no looming to-do list. Our day rotated around the five prayers. There was no distraction of the TV, radio or internet. There was no nine-to-five and it felt rejuvenating. This simplified routine brought us back to basics and with that there was a sense of freedom, tranquillity and relief.  Life was stripped back to its essence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I particularly enjoyed the evenings when, shrouded in the warm glow of our abode, the women would become better acquainted over steaming cups of sweet Turkish tea whilst crocheting, adorning hands with henna patterns or enthusiastically singing qasidas and naats. Snuggled beside the warmth of the stove, I’d write in my journal reflecting on the day’s events. Observing others, I noticed traits in me that I wished to correct and I also witnessed qualities in my sisters that I hoped to cultivate in myself. I was reminded of the hadith, ‘the believer is the mirror of the believer.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2981" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_160367555web-1024x678.jpg" alt="shutterstock_160367555(web)" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_160367555web-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_160367555web-768x508.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_160367555web-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shutterstock_160367555web-257x170.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fell ill. Now, usually when I get a little sniffle back home, the world comes to a standstill. I’ll lie on the sofa comatose (there’s a pattern emerging here somewhere) while my husband takes on the running of the house. It wasn’t so in Cyprus. I kept going although my kind sisters did make me endless cups of herbal concoctions, one of which was a blend of every single spice we could get our hands on. As expected, it tasted pretty vile, but I’d try anything to be healed. I braved the illness, as one of my dear sisters reminded me, ‘all illness is a cleansing’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were testing times. People arrived every day and with them they brought their own energy, their own heartbreak, their own purpose. On one particularly stressful morning, even the coffee pot decided it had reached boiling point and exploded in the kitchen spraying us all in henna-coloured coffee granules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When times got tough and I yearned for the comfort of home, I was reminded of how lucky I was to be here. Fatima, a sister who had travelled all the way from Canada, arrived during breakfast towards the end of our trip. She looked bewildered, ‘I worked so hard to get back here,’ she said as she went off to pray in gratitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tough times were more than outweighed by the times when I felt intense love and unity with my sisters. After Jumu’ah prayers, I felt so much love in the room I wanted to burst into tears. Like any genuine family, we had our ups and downs but I felt that each of us was unique and beautiful in our own way as truly ‘in everything in existence there are signs of Allah’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Back home in the freezing UK, we reflected upon our journey reminiscing on all the wonderful friends we had made, the delicious meals we had eaten, the warm weather we now longed for, the sites we had visited and the lack of responsibilities and worries that occupied us in those ten days. We yearned to return but my brother-in-law poignantly reminded us that the journey had just begun.  Each of us had brought back a special treasure from our spiritual expedition which we now had the responsibility of unlocking. I can’t wait to see where this journey of self-discovery will take me next.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[While looking for avenues to create renewable sources of rewards, Wardah Abbas was invited to a greener and easier way of reaping ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“You may then begin to imagine what great reward will be kept for you if over a thousand people as well as a thousand birds eat from that tree year in year out and even after you are dead.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will always remember the grand event that lead to my zeal to uncover the great secrets of the orchard. It was a friend’s wedding banquet; truly a one of a kind event and one to always look forward to when Allah (SWT) says it’s time to finally leave the chain of childhood or spinsterhood. No white wedding gowns, no white tents, no tables and chairs and no music. Everyone was seated on beautiful green fluffy rugs spread out on an expanse of green grass under the canopy of the blue sky and the cool shade of fruit trees. We had lots of fresh fruit drinks and a variety of delicious meals. There was a continuous melodious recitation from the Qur’an which made the atmosphere very serene and one to reflect upon. It was so beautiful. It was simply green and fully Islamic. It was a wedding in an orchard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The venue of the wedding was not what thrilled me the most. I was more astounded at the fact that the orchard did not belong to the families of either the bride or the groom. It was owned by a man who died over ten years ago leaving his orchard in the hands of a faithful trustee to hold it as a charitable benefit for his entire community. So, it turned out that not a single kobo was paid to anyone to benefit from it, even the couple did not pay a rental fee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I’ve come to realise over the years is that we never can tell what deed will pave our way to eternal success. We’ve heard stories in Islamic history of evil doers who later secured the mercy of Allah (SWT) with just one good deed. On the other hand, quite a large number of good people secured His wrath by one act of evil. The case of a man who extended an act of kindness to a mere dog by feeding him with water from a well and thereby securing a place in Jannah will always remain fresh in my mind. I have long been thinking in this way: “In what good act can I invest that will pave my way to Jannah?” Thoughts of being an Islamic educator have crossed my mind several times, which is still a good idea. I have also thought about drilling boreholes for a number of communities when I get the wherewithal. But not until the wedding banquet of my friend did I ever think about orchards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having an orchard is not only rewarding in this world but also in the hereafter. Apart from being a source of livelihood and a means of contributing to sustainable development, orchards are also a greener choice of <em>sadiqah jariya</em> (continuous charity), which is a renewable source of earning rewards from Allah (SWT). After the wedding, I remembered reading a hadith of the Prophet (SAW) reported by Anas Ibn Malik which says: “If a Muslim plants a tree or sows seeds, and then a bird or a person or an animal eats from it, it is regarded as a charitable gift (sadaqah) for him.” <em>(Bukhari)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may then begin to imagine what great reward will be kept for you if over a thousand people as well as a thousand birds eat from that tree year in year out and even after you are dead. What if you own a hundred trees? You will not only provide free food to many hungry people but will also provide shade to a number of people which you could never even imagine. Apart from improving the oxygen cycle in your environment, you will also earn the reward for preserving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course not everybody can own an orchard. Some may not have the wherewithal to start one; some may not have the time needed to grow it and some may feel it is not necessary since a considerable number of people in their communities already do so for financial gain. Whichever the case, not owning an orchard does not necessarily mean that you cannot participate somehow in growing one, especially for your community. There are quite a number of ways to earn continuous rewards from Allah (SWT) by participating in growing an orchard:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d968a0;"><strong>1. Conceive the idea</strong></span><br />
Your local community does not have an orchard, not even a garden that people can benefit from. Even if you are limited in terms of finances and feel that you can do little or nothing about it, you may be able to be a catalyst for something great by doing the footwork. Talk to your local community imam, telling him the benefits of starting an orchard and what it can do for the community. You can follow it up by volunteering to raise money for it and getting committed people to make it work. Make sure you put much effort into it and purify your intentions over and over again, telling yourself that it is only for the sake of Allah and not for any ulterior motive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d968a0;"><strong>2. Become a volunteer</strong></span><br />
You may dedicate some of your time; probably two hours three times a week or even once a week to work in a community orchard or a private charitable orchard. There are a variety of things to help out with such as watering the trees, cleaning the surroundings, weeding, harvesting when it is time and planting new seedlings. Contributing to the growth of an orchard is more like owning an orchard too and a very rewarding act as such. Don’t forget that there is also administrative work needed to run an orchard, perhaps you could help an orchard thrive by working on its website or aiding in various office duties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d968a0;"><strong>3. Make some donations</strong></span><br />
If you have been benefitting one way or an other from a particular orchard, then it’s likely time to give back. You may donate some seedlings or a sum of money to help in many other ways. You may also increase the sources of water in the orchard by sponsoring the drilling of a borehole or such. If on the other hand, your community needs some funds to start an orchard, you may also donate to the cause. Make sure that your act of charity is made secret and nobody except the person directly in charge of the orchard knows about it. This is how to create a renewable source of earning rewards from Allah (SWT) for yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d968a0;"><strong>4. Involve your children</strong></span><br />
Sometimes, we may think that the children are too small to participate in the little hobbies that we involve ourselves in. We are utterly wrong. Making them understand from a very young age is important in helping them nurture their eco–love right from the cradle. Watering the plants, tilling the grounds, giving petty donations and lots more &#8211; these are areas where they should actively participate. Since they will always remain our legacies after we are no more, their good activities in this world remain a renewable source of reward for us in this world and beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, uncovering the secrets of the orchard has been a fulfilling way of creating a source of sadaqa jariya for myself. And it may be an excellent opportunity for you too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Klaudia Khan shares the latest studies connecting well-being and green space.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Green is the colour most often mentioned in the Qur’an and one of the favourite colours of the Prophet (SAW). It is the colour associated with life, freshness and abundance of water; it is the colour of Jannah. No wonder we find it soothing and relaxing to look at greenery. And some recent studies confirm that the visual and sensual experience of being around green is mood-lifting, while lack of it can adversely affect our mental health. So it turns out that a green life is a happy life! I always enjoy finding modern science catching up to Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent studies conducted by the College of Environment, University of Washington, and University of Exeter Medical School confirm that green spaces deliver significant benefits to our mental health. According to the research conducted in Britain, people who live in urban areas with greater amounts of green space are happier: they show less mental distress and significantly higher wellbeing and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
So how does the greenery work on our brain? It seems that we are naturally tuned to respond positively to green outdoor environments. Research shows that natural scenes evoke positive emotions, facilitate cognitive mental processes such as creative thinking and memorising and help overcome mental fatigue for people who are in good mental health. What is more, the experience of nature can actually help in recovery from both short-term and chronic mental illness. It is a knowledge lost and found: the first hospitals in Europe, which were infirmaries in monastic communities, considered a garden an essential part of the environment and emphasised its role in the healing process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living in a busy urban environment may be exhausting for the brain, even if we were born in the city and have got used to its hubbub. Constantly navigating the outdoor environment, monitoring traffic and pedestrian flow and all the while focusing on getting somewhere and the means to get there all puts a huge strain on the brain and, if maintained over a long time, leads to stress. According to the University of Washington research, even a few minutes in a crowded city setting can cause the brain to suffer memory loss and reduce self-control. But even short breaks or glimpses of greenery can provide respite for the brain allowing it to function better. Those working in offices which have a window or at least indoor plants take significantly less sick leave and college students living on green campuses find it easier to concentrate on their studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Green spaces, or even the visual experience of greenery, act as a holiday for the brain and renew its ability to concentrate because, according to Attention Restoration Theory (ART), they possess the four features characteristic for restorative environment: green spaces bring about the sense of being away from the stressful situation, either physically or perceptually; they have scope and coherence that allows one to remain engaged; they are fascinating in a way that hold’s attention involuntarily and effortlessly and they are compatible with natural needs and desires. Some psychologists go even as far as claiming that our minds are naturally biophilic – that we have an inherent inclination to connect with green nature and that lack of that contact can negatively affect our mental health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the biophilia theory enthusiasts, the occurrence of such health problems as Attention Deficit Disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, cardiovascular disease, depression and fatigue syndrome are all connected to unhealthy and unnatural living environments and lack of outdoor play. Dealing with stress is a big problem for a modern urban city dweller and contact with nature is key in reducing the negative effects of stress. There is not yet enough research done for outside walks to be prescribed instead of anti-depressants, but there is evidence that visual and sensual contact with greenery, also known as ecotherapy, has a soothing and calming effect and can actually help in overcoming mental disorders plaguing the population of the so-called developed world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 2 million children in the U.S. have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), a condition that negatively effects their social, cognitive and psychological growth. And according to studies, children affected by ADD who get ‘green time’ (playtime in grassy outdoor spaces) experience a significant relief of the symptoms of the disorder. But outside play is not only important for children with neurodivergent issues, it is an important element of childhood development and should be incorporated into every child’s daily schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elderly people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can benefit greatly from the green outdoor spaces and it has been found that the syndromes of dementia can be reduced by some 20% by supportive green environments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-depressants are the most commonly prescribed medicines in the UK and in some countries they have been given to children as young as two years old. But some people don’t need to depend on drugs to keep their mood up. It’s been known for long time that contact with greenery and sunlight can ease depression, especially seasonal affective disorder (SAD).  A University of Essex study found that a walk in the country reduces depression in 71% of participants. Even as little as five minutes in a natural setting, whether walking in a park or gardening in the backyard, could significantly improve mood, self-esteem and motivation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all of us are fortunate enough to have a big garden or live next to a lovely park, but we should try to get at least a bit of green time every day. It could be a walk in the neighbourhood or a trip to a playground and what is important more than the quantity is the frequency of these outings. Appreciating the nature, the plants, the wildlife and the changing seasons is a great way to keep our minds healthy and just remembering that there are signs for us in all of creation is a great reminder of Allah’s (SWT) mercy and power. And combining dhikr with outdoor exercise is a great way to nurture our souls and our minds for happier, greener lives.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Raidah Shah Idil looks at the staggering facts around the problems of not having clean water.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you need to do to access clean drinking water? For most of us reading this article, all we need to do is turn on the tap and voila &#8211; instant access to clean drinking water. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case for nearly one billion people. According to www.water.org, in Africa alone, 345 million people do not have access to safe drinking water. In South East Asia, East Asia and Oceania, the number is 200 million. In developed countries, the number drops to 10 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some sobering water facts from the website:<br />
• More than 3.4 million people die each year from water, sanitation and hygiene-related causes. Nearly all deaths, 99 percent, occur in the developing world.¹<br />
• &#8220;[The water and sanitation] crisis claims more lives through disease than any war claims through guns.&#8221;²<br />
• Lack of access to clean water and sanitation kills children at a rate equivalent to that caused by a jumbo jet crashing every four hours.³</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The water crisis is particularly detrimental for women and children. Women in developing countries spend countless hours collecting water for daily use. In fact, globally, each day, women spend 200 million hours collecting water. It’s arduous, back-breaking work and often the water they do collect from polluted sources is contaminated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Surveys from 45 developing countries show that women and children bear the primary responsibility for water collection in the vast majority of households (76%). This is time not spent working at an income-generating job, caring for family members or attending school.” 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
When girls drop out of school to help their female relatives collect water, this keeps them trapped in a cycle of poverty. Additionally, the very dignity and safety of women is impacted by the water and sanitation crisis. One in three women do not have access to toilets (www.water.org). The recent gang rape and murder of two teenage cousins in India stemmed from this bleak reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
“Those two cousins, just 14 and 16 years old, had left their homes in the Indian village of Katra, in Uttar Pradesh, because they had no toilet at home. They were never to return, found hanging from a tree after being brutally attacked.” <em><span style="color: #999999;">(The Guardian)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
This is not a problem isolated to India; a WaterAid study showed that in the slums of Lagos in Nigeria, a quarter of women who did not have private access to toilets encountered threats of violence or actual assault. Similar studies have been released by Amnesty International from countries like Kenya and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From these bleak examples, it’s clear that the water and sanitation crisis has far-reaching impacts on millions of people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #570080;"><strong>What can we do to help?</strong></span><br />
Those of us who live in developed countries have been blessed with many resources, such as wealth, time, health and safety. With these blessings, we are able to reach out and support those who do not have access to clean water. When you set aside money for charity, make it a point to direct a portion of your funds towards creating safe sources of water for those in need. Donating only $25 to www.water.org, for example, will give one person access to clean water for life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As individuals and communities, let’s start fundraising to build wells for villagers who struggle to access clean drinking water. These following organisations help to build wells:<br />
• www.wateraid.org<br />
• www.water.org<br />
• www.thewaterproject.org<br />
• www.muslimaid.org/causes/water-and-sanitation/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Abu Hurairah (RA) reported: the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said, “Charity does not decrease wealth, no one forgives except that Allah increases his honour and no one humbles himself for the sake of Allah except that Allah raises his status.” <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Sahih Muslim)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Here’s a list of what you can do to reduce your water footprint:<br />
1. Install water-saving shower heads and limit your showers to<br />
5-10 minutes.<br />
2. Install water-saving flushes.<br />
3. Install a rainwater harvesting system in your home.<br />
4. Wait until your dishwasher is fully loaded before running it.<br />
5. Turn off the tap when you brush your teeth.<br />
6. Dedicate one day a week when you run the washing machine.<br />
7. If possible, install a compost toilet in place of the conventional ones.<br />
8. Teach your children about the value of water.<br />
9. Make the intention to raise funds to build a well.<br />
10. While making du’a, remember those who don’t have access to clean water and sanitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #570080;"><strong>Greywater</strong></span><br />
From a permaculture design perspective, installing a greywater system in your home is an excellent way to conserve water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greywater is defined as used water from our homes which has not come in contact with human waste. Even though greywater may look murky and contain traces of food or dirt, it can actually be really good for our gardens. Diverting greywater to our gardens instead of our rivers and seas is a win-win strategy &#8211; our plants get natural fertiliser and our waterways won’t be as polluted. To make this possible, it’s important to first have a household which is committed to using non-toxic soaps and detergents. This means not using shampoos and cleaners with ingredients we can’t pronounce! What we pour down our drains will come out of our pipes and into our gardens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The simplest way to use greywater is to pipe it out of our homes, using gravity and into our fruit trees and ornamental trees.  The greywateraction.org website describes the simplest way of greywater usage: “Washing machines are typically the easiest source of greywater to reuse because greywater can be diverted without cutting into existing plumbing. Each machine has an internal pump that automatically pumps out the water &#8211; you can use that to your advantage to pump the greywater directly to your plants.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #570080;"><strong>Rainwater harvesting</strong></span><br />
I think of rainwater harvesting as having sponges on my roof and garden. These ‘sponges’ catch, slow down and conserve water that would otherwise become run-off. Imagine what you can do with stored rainwater during times of drought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In Malaysia, many people are skeptical about rainwater because of the fear of acid rain. The solution is simple. Place some limestone into your rainwater harvesting system to neutralise any acidity. Rainwater will then be perfectly safe for you to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
All in all, there is so much we can do on as communities and individuals to help alleviate the global water crisis. I pray that Allah Most High grants us success in our endeavours to conserve water and help those affected by the global water and sanitation crisis.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Klaudia Khan shares some green wisdom from her senior relatives.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our elders have a lot of wisdom to share with us, but we are not always ready to listen to them. They may give us good advice based on their knowledge and experience, but we stubbornly insist on learning from our own mistakes. Then, at some point, we realise that they were right and had we listened to them earlier, we would have saved ourselves lots of trouble. With my newly developed eco-consciousness, I have come to recognise and appreciate the guidance given to me by my parents, grandparents and in-laws, who often lead green lifestyles without even realising. For them, green choices that we consciously make and often struggle to keep are just normal, common-sense decisions. They were raised in the pre-consumerist era, when people truly led a sustainable lifestyle and wastage could not be afforded. The world around them has changed and the standards have changed too; the new philosophy of ever-wanting-more has affected everyone. However, the ideals that were instilled in their minds at a young age &#8211; the principles of truly sustainable life in harmony with nature &#8211; still guide them and can be lessons for us, too. That is, once we get over our infatuation with the fast, modern, careless lifestyle. Let me share with you some re-discovered pearls of green wisdom from my elders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“The best vegetables are the ones that grow in your own garden. The carrots from the shop just look too good to be truly good” &#8211; my late father, Zbigniew.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was blessed to grow up in a house with a huge garden which my father lovingly cultivated and which supplied our kitchen with lots of vegetables, herbs, greens and fruit. I did not appreciate it at the time and the only time I could be seen in the garden was when the strawberries were ripe – eating them straight from the patch! I used to find excuses to avoid any work in the garden and now I regret that I missed the chance to learn gardening from my father. Now I’m trying to grow some herbs on the windowsill of my flat in England, but it turns out  it’s not as easy as I thought. I miss my family house and garden in Poland and the taste of real, natural vegetables and fruit freshly picked from the patch!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“If I don’t know it, I don’t eat it” </em><em>&#8211; my maternal grandmother, Janina.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes in the supermarket I get tempted to look for a creamy cake or fancy chocolate dessert, but when I look at the ingredient list to make sure it’s halal or vegetarian, I see a list too long to be read standing in the aisle and blocking the way &#8211; I feel I should be a scientist to understand it! I’d imagine cake is made from flour and eggs and butter and sugar, but I cannot even imagine what half of the ingredients listed on the box would look like. So I put that box back on the shelf, remembering my granny’s motto, and look for something more familiar. Eating only what I know does not mean that I would not try new dishes, but it means that I would try to eat foods made from good natural products, nothing concocted, derived or modified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Why would someone give their children all this vitamin-enriched rubbish? Give them good pure ghee and wholemeal foods and they will have all the vitamins they need” </em><em>&#8211; my mother-in-law, Naheed.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On every box of children’s cereal or sweet yoghurt you can read information like ‘Vitamin D is important for your bones’ or ‘Contains vitamins and minerals’. Yes, lots of these products might be artificially enriched in vitamins and minerals, but predominantly they consist of sugar and often artificial colours and flavours. The big sweets manufacturers and the TV have spoilt our children’s diet and even convinced us that something as high in sugar as a bowl of sugary Frosties might be a healthy breakfast! My mother-in-law feeds her grandchildren with lots of love and some wholemeal parathas fried in pure clarified butter and served with free-range eggs. Now, this I can trust to be a healthy breakfast! But I have to admit it’s just recently that I realised the truth about highly processed and highly sweetened foods that are often marketed as ‘healthy’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Make it a habit to turn off the lights” &#8211; my father-in-law, Niaz.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turning off the lights is such an obvious eco-conscious practice. It is so easy to switch off the lamp when leaving the room. And it is equally easy to forget it. I used to forget and leave the microwave oven on standby and my father-in-law used to remind me every day to turn it off. And his continuous reminders really did help me in developing a habit of switching it off and it also extended to checking all other appliances and lights in the kitchen. So much energy and water is wasted without us realising and we are not in the habit of saving it. So it does need a conscious decision to make a change and it needs some perseverance and discipline to develop good green habits &#8211;  something elders do understand to be important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“You never know what you are going to need” &#8211; my late father, Zbigniew.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father didn’t like throwing away things and he was great at fixing things and doing everything himself, from building our family house to growing his own vegetables to making a kitchen table from re-used wood. In our home, books and toys that were damaged were always fixed – not thrown away or replaced. My father even used to fix our shoes if they needed some stitches or a bit of glue to hold the sole on properly. In the world of fast fashion and easy bargains, these practices may seem eccentric, but older generations were blessed to grow up in times when things had their value and you didn’t just go shopping to kill time. For them, money might have been the biggest issue, but even if we are not restricted financially we should at least remember now that the planet, its delicate ecosystem and its precious resources are the biggest issue. So now I do fix my children’s  broken toys and torn books, and I even fixed my daughter’s slipper’s broken sole with a bit of superglue! I’m a frugal mother and proud &#8211; just like my father would wish me to be!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“If you buy something and pay all that money, then buy something good and solid” &#8211; my maternal grandmother Janina.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My grandmother would scorn the purchases of some fast fashion shoes, saying that they looked as if they would only last five minutes. This is not how she would have spent her money; she would think it’s better to buy a quality pair of shoes that would last more than a season than to buy three and throw them all away when the season ends. In her youth, she used to save money to buy good shoes. There were fewer shops and less to choose from, but the produce was of better quality and therefore had its price. In those days, there were no sweatshops supplying customers in rich countries with fast fashion at the expense of poorer countries’ resources and human lives. Also, people used to buy things when they really needed them, when what they had could not be fixed any more, and so there was minimal wastage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Why buy water when it comes clean and free from the tap?” – my late father, Zbigniew.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Producing one gallon of bottled water takes two gallons to make it and most of the plastic bottles end up in the landfills or floating in the seas. Our parents and grandparents had too much common sense to buy bottled water no different to water coming from the tap. We, too, should be smarter than the bottled water producers would like us to be and drink tap water instead!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living an eco-conscious life may seem hard at times, but in reality we are very privileged these days; we have so much choice &#8211; much more than our elders used to have. Being thankful for what we are blessed with is yet another green lesson to be learnt from them, insha Allah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Written by Qaanitah Hunter &#124; Published by WordFlute Press &#124; Reviewed by Fatima Bheekoo Shah]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Diary of a Guji </em>(short for Gujirati)<em> Girl</em> has reached fandom status in South Africa. The blog where the book originated from received over two million views, and the novel sold 500 copies in its first week. The author, Qaanitah Hunter, is a hard-hitting political journalist in South Africa and began the blog as a light-hearted, somewhat tongue-in-cheek collage of people and events she’d encountered along the way. To some extent, blogging offered her a distraction from her fast-paced and hectic life as journalist, and she was astounded by its popularity. People would share new posts via email and instant message as everyone was looking for their daily fix of the next part in the series. At one stage, seemingly everyone and anyone were talking about the blog, even that aunty at your local halaqah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story revolves around the character Amina, a naïve young woman who hails from the small town of Newcastle in Kwa Zulu Natal. She comes from a cultural Indian background and arrives in Johannesburg to study teaching. Armed with a few cooking skills and modest dress sense, she regards herself as ultimate marriage material. This is her definitive goal for studying at university. She aspires to find the perfect “nice rich boy” who she can show off back home, while living the life of a pampered, rich, spoilt wife. Why else would a small town girl come to the big city to study? She meets her match in Moe, but he comes with some serious headaches &#8211; things are not as smooth sailing and easy as she thought they would be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book moves at a rapid pace as Amina goes from being a narcissistic, materialistic girl with small town ideologies to someone who questions who she really is and emerges somewhat more confident and less judgmental.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book also gives us a glimpse into Muslim Indian communities in South Africa, while addressing the prejudices surrounding class culture and wealth from within. Coming from an Indian background, I must admit that I am grateful for parents who put religion before culture. I was astounded at some of the practices and prejudices I read about in <em>Diary of A Guji Girl</em>. It was all foreign to me but judging by the response to the blog, I am guessing these problems are normal for many people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must admit I never read the blog so this book was read with no expectations on my part. Qaanitah has an impressive, easygoing writing style that I loved. I can see why she attracted two million hits to her blog. It was good clean fun and entertained me for the most part. I loved that she tackled certain stereotypes we have in our communities with humour, honesty and a touch of sensitivity. I also think she is brave for doing so. I found myself laughing aloud at certain parts at the sheer ridiculousness of it all. The story had me gripped at some interludes and at times, I was just frustrated with the main character’s gumption or lack thereof. But Amina grows on you and pretty soon, you are rooting for her and you hope that after everything that happens to her, she emerges unscathed from the ordeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An excellent and entertaining read, let’s hope to see many more of these kind of novels, edited with just the right type of tenacity which made for a fun, engaging and uplifting story. It’s the perfect holiday read!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author’s background is interesting. Qaanitah Hunter is a political reporter at the Mail and Guardian in South Africa. When she is not talking to politicians, she’s also a tear gas dodging hijabi. She is a graduate of Madressa Islaahul Muslimaat and studies political science at the University of South Africa. I hope she writes another novel &#8211; she has exceptional talent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Morocco, North Africa. What does that conjure up in your mind? Endless desert dunes and camels? Yes, but you may be surprised to know that it is also incredibly green and fertile with agricultural regions, forests, oases and is just about as diverse as a country could get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Majestic mountains with their seasonal adornment of snow glow a rosy pink in the dwindling sunset. In their hills are hidden neatly terraced valleys full of fruit trees and crops, feeding a myriad of small Berber villages scattered along the most beautiful river courses, which in turn are fed from spectacular waterfalls formed from snowmelt. The cycle of life in these mountains has hardly changed for generations. In early spring, the delicate pink almond blossoms fill the hillsides, followed by plums, apricots, figs, apples and pomegranates. Walnuts are also grown in these protected valleys. The vast plateaus are a lush green of the swaying wheat grown for grinding into flour, animal fodder and part of the traditional mix that makes the mud bricks to build houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Magnificent waterfalls cascade in multi tiers, casting fantastic rainbows as they tumble down past rustic riverside restaurants serving delicious local dishes. Indigenous Barbary monkeys venture down to seek food from visitors. Well-trodden paths lead the adventurous to hidden caves tucked away amongst oak and olive woods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Down at sea level, charming coastal medinas along the Atlantic are a haven for artists and wanderers. Full of history, atmosphere, hidden treasures and artisan delights, these towns are adorned with vibrantly painted doors in shades of blues that make them irresistible to photograph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3266" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_193344416web-1024x1024.jpg" alt="shutterstock_193344416(web)" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_193344416web-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_193344416web-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_193344416web-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_193344416web-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_193344416web-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_193344416web.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ancient red ochre kasbahs stand in regal silence, each one with its carved decoration telling a unique story in the symbols of the local tongue. Walled gardens follow the rivers for dozens of kilometres with verdant oases of palms dripping with succulent dates. The waters wander south, carving a way to the distant desert sands which eventually absorb them completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gorges split apart the mountains, revealing breathtaking views as corkscrew roads lead into secret villages and lush valleys flush with the finest Damascus roses. The prized essential oils and beauty products produced here are sought after the world over. Rock formations that look like fat monkey fingers amaze the passing convoys of travellers. And, yes, there are deserts, vast tracts of land once covered by water long since absorbed. They have given up some of their hidden fossils and geological treasures to knowledgeable locals. Dinosaur bones and ancient fossils of many different species can be seen in museums and shops, along with exquisite semi-precious gems and rocks mined in the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morocco has much to offer visitors, many places to explore and a wealth of history, landscape, culture and lifestyle to absorb. Its vibrant colours, heady aromas and endless artisan displays will give you many reasons to linger. A visit to the silent distant deserts with a night spent under the vast canopy of stars, that seem so close you are sure you could touch them, will give you many reasons to want to come back and feel again that peace that speaks to your soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wonderful people, about 80% of whom are indigenous Amazigh or Berber people, will welcome you as they go about their daily tasks, and often offer you to ”Come and have some tea”, hot and sweet but very refreshing with the distinctive aroma of fresh mint which is so much a part of Moroccan life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who have been and understand, for those yet to come and for those who need no reason, these are the places I recommend that you visit in Morocco:</p>
<p>• Marrakech for me is the heart of Morocco; from here you have many opportunities and options. The old Medina bustles with its souks full of artisans, ancient and not-so-old superb monuments and gardens. Marrakech has great street food, atmosphere and a soul that speaks to you from old and deep in the earth. It’s a dynamic city, colourful, aromatic, busy and vibrant. Marrakech is the gateway to the south and the road to go north. It´s the way to the coast and the route for the mountains. A perfect central point to explore Morocco from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The High Atlas Mountains are majestically stunning and full of hidden secrets for you to discover. South of Marrakech, they are a hiking and trekking paradise for groups and families alike. All the year round there is something to experience. Visit villages like Imlil on your way to climb Mount Toubkal, the lakeside village of Lalla Takerkouste with its weekly souk, or the spectacular valley of Aït Bougamez. These mountains are home to many small Amazigh villages with their secluded valleys and hidden gems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The Middle Atlas Mountains are a nature lover’s playground featuring lakes, forests of huge cedars, volcanic plateaus, waterfalls and Morocco´s ‘Little Switzerland’. Deep snow in the winter makes it an international ski resort that becomes a hikers dream in the late spring and early summer. The great cedar forests in the Ifrane National park are home to the Barbary monkeys. Lakes full of huge mirror carp are wonderful retreats for fishermen, as well as perfect grounds for bird watchers, for horse riding and hand-made crafts lovers. Here women make some of Morocco´s most beautiful carpets, carpenters carve superb furniture and a huge variety of baskets are woven for sale in the souks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The Dades Valley is home to more than a thousand kasbahs in varying states of splendour. This valley is also famously home to the Damascus rose. You can visit dramatic gorges and wild rock formations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The Ounila Valley is the ancient route of the caravans from Tombouktou and is still the salt route of today. Visit the UNESCO heritage site at Ksar Aït Benhaddou where so many famous blockbuster movies were filmed, and the palace of the old warlords of the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The Ourika Valley, despite being so well publicised, is still on this list because it has much to offer for a day out from Marrakech. If you only had one day I would suggest going &#8211; why? It is beautiful all year round, with saffron and organic farms, gardens, fantastic riverside restaurants, waterfalls and traditional Berber houses to visit. You can go on a camel or horse ride, and if you continue to Oukaimeden you can go skiing. And that is only some of what there is to see and do!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The Draa Valley is an extended oasis that carves its way to the desert dunes of Chegaga through Tamnougalt, Agdez, Zagora and M´hamid. Tamnougalt is a fascinating old Kasbah, once a Jewish settlement and also known for the Haritine people who are black descendants from the region of Mali. Situated on the caravan route, it was once a major caravanserai &#8211; a meeting and trading place. Parts of it have been restored and some families still live there. Stop here for an interesting guided tour by one of the locals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The Ziz Valley takes you down the eastern side of the country through diverse scenery, to the desert dunes of Erg Chebbi and the towns of Merzouga, Rissani and Efroud. A Spanish influence is very apparent here as exiles from the Kingdom of Granada in Andalucia came to this region to help populate the area, bringing with them their language and some architectural influences. A staggering amount of fossils, dinosaur bones, semi-precious rocks and crystals can be seen here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Fez and Meknes are the oldest Medinas with a character all of their own and well worth a visit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Essaouira and Asilah are two of the most charming coastal medinas on the Atlantic seaboard. With their vibrant blue doors and street art, their array of fish, seafood and sandy beaches, these towns provide a great respite from the inland vistas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are only my top ten choices, as obviously I could prattle on about all the places I love in Morocco. Come and see for yourselves!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give”, said the famous ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ayesha is a young South African female who has travelled the path less travelled for most of her life. She has donned the niqab from a young age and she, as well as her two younger siblings, was homeschooled by her mum at a time when little was known (and a lot was frowned upon) about this type of education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Many people did not agree with the decision my parents made about our education. It was extremely difficult for my mother to stay true to what she believed was the right thing to do for us”, explains Ayesha, “and we didn’t make it any easier! There were days when we were not dedicated but troublesome and unruly. At the same time, we all felt a need to succeed so that we could prove the naysayers wrong and make my mother proud.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another challenge her mother charged her children with was to memorise the Holy Qur’an.  Under her tutelage Ayesha memorised the entire Qur’an at the age of 16, thus earning the honour of being a Haafidh ul Qur’an. From there on, she studied further and received a Bachelor of Science degree through a distance learning university in South Africa (UNISA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After marrying Qari Ziyaad Patel – one of the founding fathers of the Al-Imdaad Foundation of South Africa, Ayesha was roped in to do work that she had never before believed she could do: relief work around the globe in some of the worst disaster zones imaginable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Early Days</strong></span><br />
Ayesha’s first trip as a relief worker was to Indonesia after the devastating tsunami had ravaged the country. “I was not prepared as much as I thought I was,” remembers Ayesha. “The sight of all the desolation and carnage was overwhelming! There’s only so much that the human body and mind can take until it shuts down and makes you numb – almost immune – to the wreckage around you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She returned home from that project fiercely determined to give all of her belongings away to charity and to sleep on the floor. “I was ashamed to live a good, safe and healthy life here in South Africa. I felt like such a hypocrite and was propelled to just give everything away!” At that point, Ayesha’s husband, Qari Ziyaad, stepped in and explained that this madness was not what Islam taught. “Ziyaad calmed me down. He told me that I should look at what I have as blessings from Allah (SWT), and not as burdens.” At this turning point, Ayesha realised that the aim was not to live like the many victims she had encountered, but to be grateful for what Allah (SWT) had given her. “What would I achieve by living like the victims I met?” she asks. “ Ziyaad helped me realise that we are able to help and to give and to comfort precisely because Allah (SWT) has given us a family to come home to, a warm shower and a soft bed. It is what keeps you sane when you’re in a country far away, trying to communicate in a language you don’t understand, treating the ill and burying the dead.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>“Always be prepared”</strong></span><br />
Ayesha has adopted the age old Boy Scouts motto of always being prepared. “Relief work can be very demanding and taxing, more so on the Muslim woman than on any other. Basic hygiene services, which we take for granted here at home, are mostly unavailable. It is difficult to remain clean and so we’re forced to think out of the box when it comes to maintaining our tahara”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;(Women) are much more suited to this type of work because of the innate empathy that Allah (SWT) has given us. Our indomitable strength, our selflessness, our immense capacity to love – all these qualities that make a mother, make a really good relief worker.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relief workers are given anything from 24 hours to two days notice before departure. Ayesha has learnt to prepare for the worst and is always ready to leave for a disaster zone at any time. Her suitcases, first aid kit and food basket always being re-stocked and re–packed immediately upon return. “I take everything with me, except my toilet!” she jokes, “and when I find a portable loo that fits in my bag, you can bet I’m going to take it with me!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning to cope with the bare necessities in such adverse conditions can only make one stronger. Ayesha agrees, “I underestimated myself the first few times I travelled out to a disaster area. Living and coping with next to nothing forces you to make shukr for what you do have, and it is that shukr to Allah (SWT) that gives you the strength to adapt to your surroundings and persevere.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>“The best of times, the worst of times”</strong></span><br />
Natural disasters can totally annihilate the face of a country, leaving in the wake of its aftermath, victims completely shell shocked and numb. Although every trip stands out for Ayesha, there are two that have left an indelible mark for very conflicting reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Haiti was the worst and the most difficult. We got there three days after the earthquake. The trip was arduous and the conditions were appalling. Ziyaad and I were the only two South Africans in our team. Ziyaad fell quite ill and it was difficult as we were alone in a country where the language, the customs and the people were very different. I was alone with an ill husband and relief work to do,” says Ayesha, “I lost 6kgs on that project. Needless to say, it was the most harrowing of our experiences! But shukr, we got through it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the bleak picture painted above, Ayesha speaks fondly about the Muslims of the Dominican Republic. “Here, “ she says, “we met Muslims who truly appreciated the word of Allah (SWT). These Muslims had no knowledge of Arabic and the Imam of the masjid knew just the basics &#8211; enough to read salah. So they would beg for us to read Qur’an to them and to teach them more. When they would listen to Ziyaad recite, they would sob and beg for more. Here we found Muslims whose hearts truly yearned for the words of Allah (SWT).”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Healing the soul</strong></span><br />
Helping and assisting tens of thousands of traumatised people in appalling circumstances can take its toll on even the strongest of men. To prevent mental breakdowns, trauma counselling is imperative upon return for all relief workers. Relief workers are encouraged to participate in group counselling, as well as talking to others who have experienced similar things, which can help ease the trauma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Ayesha’s case, she and Ziyaad are a source of peace for each other. “You would think that being in such difficult and tense situations would only lead to arguments between the two of us but Alhamdulillah, it is not so. Ziyaad and I are a strength for each other. At night, when we talk about our day, the horrors our bodies and minds encountered is appeased slightly,” she says, “By sharing what we saw, we help each other to move on.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No human being can be immersed in such a mentally, physically and spiritually taxing job for long periods of time. Having a hobby or taking time-out are essential to allow oneself a break from all the gloom and despair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I love to cook,” says Ayesha. “My kitchen is my sanctuary where I can forget about the world and its problems and concentrate only on the dish I am making.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a firm family support group also works wonders. Knowing that there are people who love you unconditionally and who worry about you helps ease the pain that relief workers experience when faced with distressing situations. For Ayesha, her family proved to be a lifesaver after an extremely harrowing trip to Haiti. “The trip to Haiti was one of the most difficult we had ever undertaken. Thankfully, our family realised this and when we returned, took Ziyaad and I away for a family holiday. It was, by far, the best trauma counselling we had ever received! Just being enveloped in their love and care soothed us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly however, is the trust that Muslims have in Allah (SWT). “Just knowing that “for the believer, even in affliction, there is some good” helps us to cope with what we do. Our faith teaches us that this is a test and our trust in Allah (SWT) keeps us sane,” explains Ayesha. “I have come across many who question why such terrible things happen and whom cannot make peace with it. They are constantly riddled with doubt. That’s the beautiful part of our religion – our steadfastness and belief in Allah (SWT) keeps us sane and helps us make sense of what is happening around us.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Bursting the bubble</strong></span><br />
As a young twenty–something Niqaabi on the frontlines of disaster zones, it is only natural that Ayesha is shattering the stereotype the West has held for so long about Muslim women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In the disaster areas, I have never been treated negatively because of my hijab and niqab”, says Ayesha. “Relief workers are not a sheltered breed because they are exposed to so many surprising factors on a daily basis. My dress is met with curiosity rather than animosity and I have learnt that talking to people puts them at ease immediately. They realise that I can speak English well, am not a poor oppressed soul and that I choose to dress this way.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not to say that Ayesha and Ziyaad have not been criticised by outsiders for their dress. On a two month Liverpool stay, during a postgraduate course in Disaster Management at the University of Liverpool, they were accosted a few times and verbally attacked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ve had my niqab torn off my face and alcohol thrown at us as we walked home from the University,” recounts Ayesha. “One day, a British lady grabbed Ziyaad and yelled at him for burning my face and then having the nerve to hide me behind the veil. So I removed my veil and we explained why I wore it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dealing with prejudice can be stressful on many levels but Ayesha has found that plain yet polite speaking usually sets things aright. “I’ve had a few of my preconceived notions dismantled as well. You cannot blame people for their ignorance for they are bombarded by the media with negative images and statements regarding Muslims. They’re forming opinions based on all the wrong information they are being fed. Standing up for myself dispelled their ignorance.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The mere fact that I could speak English would astound our accosters,” she laughs. “We must not keep quiet when faced with prejudice. We must open their eyes and make them aware that we are educated and that the Muslim woman is not an oppressed woman.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In stark contrast, Ayesha and Ziyaad were treated most hospitably in Milan, where they studied for their Master’s Degree in 2010. “We encountered absolutely no Islamophobia in Milan and were treated with utmost respect by everyone!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>“If the world were run by women, there’d be no war”</strong></span><br />
“We need more women out in the field, “ urges Ayesha. “We are much more suited to this type of work because of the innate empathy that Allah (SWT) has given us. Our indomitable strength, our selflessness, our immense capacity to love – all these qualities that make a mother, make a really good relief worker. I feel that women are ten times better as humanitarian aid workers than men are.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only are more women needed in the field, but more Muslims in general. Natural disasters in Islamic countries are on the rise and the Muslim victims come into contact with a lot of Christian relief workers who try to convert them to Christianity. As Ayesha explains, “In Indonesia, Christian relief workers were handing out food packs to families. Every food pack was accompanied by a Bible and a rosary. This is a time for da’wah and we are not upholding the responsibility of the deen!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Why do you go back?</strong></span><br />
“Because I love what I do,” she answers. “ When the people smile back at me, I know that somehow, in a tiny way, I helped to make a difference. And I have hope that this tiny bit I am doing will please Allah (SWT), Insha Allah.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On her days at home, Ayesha is busy running local social responsibility programmes, winter blanket drives and food collections. As she says, “Life is too dynamic to sit still and be idle. We need to take everything in our stride, and do as much as we can for as long as we can.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Raidah Shah Idil talks to Atika Irfan who explains why she is trying her best to avoid feeding her family with GMO food.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first met Atika Irfan at a weekend Permaculture workshop run by Rhamis Kent in KL, Malaysia. She is a wife and a mother of three and a director of Basatin Filahah Permaculture. I admire her commitment to providing a non-GMO diet for her family. Here’s what she had to share with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c40291;"><em><strong>1. What is the definition of a non-GMO diet?</strong></em></span><br />
This is a diet that does not contain any genetically modified food in any form, including genetically engineered salmon fish; grains, like corn; soybean and veggies, such as potato, eggplant and tomato. Animal meat raised on GMOs (genetically modified organisms) and milk from these animals should also be excluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c40291;"><strong><em>2. Why is a GMO diet harmful for ourselves and our children?  </em></strong></span><br />
GMOs are outright dangerous. Just as nature is designed to respond to what is available, our DNA responds to changes that it is exposed to. Our DNA will replicate itself with the available material and if that material is faulty, then the copy made is a faulty one. The genes inserted into GMOs won’t necessarily get attached at desired locations on the host DNA and when RNA (a decoder of DNA which makes all kinds of protein encoded in our DNA) makes protein from that faulty DNA, it makes novel proteins that have never existed in our bodies or in nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, we have all sorts inflammations in the body. The inflammation inside our bodies is like a civil war inside our bodies; the body is at war with itself. Take the example of the Bt gene inserted into GMOs. This Bt gene produces toxins that make us sick. When we eat GMOs, the Bt gene gets into the microbes in our guts and turns these microbes in a Bt toxin factories. These toxins punch molecular holes in our gut and, as a result, things that should not get into our blood then enter into our blood and create all sorts of allergies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we feed GMOs to our animals in the form of corn cake and soya cake (a grain cake is made from the leftover compressed grains when oil has been extracted). Just as the GMOs affect our DNA, they affect animals in the same way, so their DNA also changes. So now we are looking at both animal protein and plant-based food damaging us at a DNA level and causing inflammation in our body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When lab rats were fed GMOs, they developed cancers, immune system problems, heart problems, digestive system problems and reproductive problems. The reproductive problems came in with the third generation of consumers eating GMOs. GMOs were introduced in our diets in the late nineties so our children are the ones who have been exposed to GMOs since they were born. For example, our children consumed milk formulas made from soya and milk from animals fed on GMO. The damage from GMOs will start showing in future generations growing up consuming them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GMOs were designed to survive the chemicals sprayed on them in the form of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. These chemicals are chelators and are designed to change nutrients and minerals in soil in a way that it is not available to weeds, but also the plants grown for food. So plants grow without these essential minerals/nutrients, creating nutrient deficient food. When animals eat this nutrient deficient food, they too become nutrition deficient, get sick and have a higher chance of premature death. There is well-documented evidence that animals fed on GMOs long enough died due to manganese deficiency. So when we eat plants and animals deficient in nutrition, we also become sick and have higher chances of premature death or chronic disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c40291;"><strong><em>3. What are some practical steps on how to create a non-GMO diet for our homes?</em></strong></span><br />
The best answer is to grow your own food as much as possible. Join a community garden or an urban farm in cities if you don’t have enough space. This saves a lot of money and is healthy for you and the planet. If you don’t have that option of growing food for yourself, then buy organic and compost grown food. Organic is GMO-free and pesticide-free. The compost grown available in Malaysia is safe, as far as I know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start to wean your family off GMOs. Make a plan. Substitute one product at a time. Read labels on all food products. Unfortunately Malaysia does not have a policy that allows us to know if GMOs have been added to a product, so buy only organic products. That’s the only way to be sure. Avoid all products that have GMO ingredients, e.g oils, flours, breads, cakes, cookies, potato chips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c40291;"><strong><em>4. What challenges have you faced in implementing a non-GMO diet for yourself and your family?</em></strong></span><br />
When I decided that we have to change to a non-GMO diet, the biggest challenge was overcoming the mindset of my family &#8211; why should we spend so much on food? I had to explain that we were getting sick from eating &#8220;normal&#8221; food. When we get sick from it, we have to spend more money treating diseases and then waste time and energy when sick. The heartache involved when a child is sick is enough to make me eat GMO-free food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started with leafy greens and slowly changed most items to organic and non-GMO food. We have stopped eating meat every day and only eat chicken once a week. The price of organic food is my biggest challenge, so I decided to grow my own food as much as I can. I live in a terrace house and am experimenting with what kinds of food I can grow. So far yams and kangkong (water spinach) have been the easiest to grow. Herbs are great too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c40291;"><em><strong>5. Do you have anything else you&#8217;d like to share?</strong></em></span><br />
My mum has health issues and one of her monthly medicines costs RM500 (approximately £100). My dad is able to afford this. I am not sure if my husband will be able to afford this kind money just for one person so, all things considered, the organic and compost grown food is cheaper than getting sick and spending money in hospitals and on medicine. It is easier to grow a food garden than to watch a loved one fall sick and not be themselves or healthy and happy. I have seen too many sick people and I know exactly what goes on in the health industry because my father is a doctor.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Mashaal Mir investigates the Muslim Youth Helpline and discovers that help is only a phone call away.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s quiet. No words are being spoken; there is only noise in the background. At first it’s hard to decode what the noise is. Then it becomes clear; the cold, shivering noise sounds like teetering respiration. And then he speaks. “My mother says I’m a Muslim because I was born into this family. But I don’t feel like one. My parents are getting divorced and my mom is always stressed. I do things I know are wrong. But it numbs the pain for a while. I feel trapped”. His voice is soaked with defeat. “I don’t know what to do. Help me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then the line goes dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twenty four thousand. That is the number of times the phone has rung on the first floor of an old building situated in London. And 24,000 times (and growing as you read this) there has been a voice that softly asks: “Hello, this is Muslim Youth Help Line, how can I help?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established nine years ago in the bedroom of 18-year-old Mohammed Mamdani, the <a href="http://www.myh.org.uk/" target="_blank">Muslim Youth Helpline </a>(MYH) has grown from a young man’s ambitious initiative to the only helpline dedicated to the British Muslim youth. Mr Mamdani, with pencils and a father willing to pay the phone bill, formed the foundations of the helpline which confronts problems facing the Muslim youth today. The authentic example above, portrayed by actors to protect the identity of the caller, is only one of the 500 enquires that monthly pour into the MYH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dressed in a white Asian-inspired shirt and dark blue jeans, Bengali Milad Ahmed is the Head of the Support Services. He is young and dedicated. When asked about the helpline, currently with 100 workers, mostly volunteers, Mr Ahmed makes a clear statement. “Even though we have ‘Muslim’ in our title, it doesn’t make us a faith based organisation,” he says in his mellifluous voice. “We are a faith sensitive organisation. This means we are non-judgmental and we try to take into account the cultural implications of what it means to be a Muslim.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the conversations that the MYH has with Muslims aged between 16 and 25 are not for the faint-hearted nor are they dinner conversations; stories of sexual abuse, relationship problems and mental health have had people like Fazal Khan, 26, working hard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Khan is a part of the group which proves to be the backbone of the MYH; the helpline volunteers. For six months, he has been talking and chatting with help-seeking Muslims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Naturally there are a few exceptions, but young Muslims have the same problems that other young people might have,” Mr Khan says. “Relationships, drugs, bullying and depression all come to the surface.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking the bull by its horns is never easy. The organisation is dealing with delicate issues that are still considered to be taboo in the Muslim community. In fact, having a helpline to confront the community’s disguised problems is controversial in itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Generally, the most common concerns are mental illnesses and relationships,” Mr Ahmed states and for a reason. Mental illness is considered a highly taboo subject; kept strictly within the four walls of a household and concealed from the outside world. Though no specific figures regarding mental illnesses among the Muslim community are currently available, the MYH states in its most recent report that almost 30 per cent of all conversations involve Muslims desperately battling depression and isolation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Ahmed admits that the topic of mental illnesses is still a precarious area. “The reason we find mental illness to be a big issue at MYH is because of the perception in certain sections of the Muslim community, where signs of weak iman &#8211; faith &#8211; are associated with mental illnesses. Many Muslims therefore see MYH as a space to talk about their distress. This is also why we are currently trying to educate and raise awareness through campaigning.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2005, the Federation of Student Islamic Societies (FOSIS) ran a survey which revealed that about half of all students asked had experienced Islamophobia. For this article, a survey sent out to various universities across England &#8211; UCL, Kingston, Southampton, among others &#8211; unveiled that 46 per cent of participants believed that Islamophobia was on the rise while almost 50 per cent said they felt unwelcome in Britain as a direct result of hate crime and racism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is a vigorous debate about whether Islamophobia is the root of mental illnesses among young Muslims. While one anonymous survey participant said, “I definitely think there is some correlation between racism and depression,” another one argued, “As I live in a multicultural area I find it difficult to believe there is a clear association between Islamophobia and depression.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Here at MYH we’ve had few concerns about Islamophobia. The majority of the time the problems, such as depression, are related to family and culture,” Mr Ahmed explains. “Our popular advocacy  website, Muslim Youth, has concerns related to Islamophobia.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite its efforts, the helpline has only touched the tip of the iceberg. Being a small charity, relying heavily on donations means restricted resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The need for the service is far greater than what we can provide at the moment,” Mr Ahmed says. “If we handle 15 calls, we miss about 30 enquiries. And that’s on a daily basis. We need more funding.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A quick calculation reveals the number 840. That’s how many young Muslims end up listening to a busy tone rather than the aiding voice of a volunteer &#8211; every month. Another calculation and a new number pops up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10,080.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s how many Muslims, on a yearly basis, are going to bed with their anxieties still in their heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaving the small building, it’s difficult to grasp the reality that thousands of Muslims are relying on an organisation that can hardly take four calls concurrently. Yet, the pleading, broken voice of a young man from a donation ad comes to mind: “Dear MYH. Please.  Please help me ‘cos I am suffering every minute, of every hour, of every day. Can you help me?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Mr Ahmed leaves for the day, he knows, at least for those able to get their enquiry through, the answer is yes.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Maria Zain meets other sisters who are in inter-cultural marriages, revealing the highs and the lows.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inter-cultural marriages are one of those gems found in Muslim communities. With marriages being the cornerstone in a thriving Muslim community, Allah (SWT) reminds us that inter-cultural marriages are amongst those signs that remind his followers of the diversity of Allah’s creation from a single source; different languages and cultures are signs for those who reflect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Surah Ar-Rum, Allah (SWT) says:<br />
<em><strong>“Amongst His signs is that He created you from dust; then, suddenly you were human beings dispersing throughout the earth. And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought. And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colours. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.” </strong>(Ar-Rum: 22)</em><br />
Allah (SWT) reiterates in this verse the importance of spreading love and mercy amongst our diverse population and an example of this is the relationship between spouses He creates for each other. However, these verses serve as reminders because there are instances where marital relations do become strained, and this can be just as common, if not more so, amongst spouses of different ethnic origins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Smoothing out the challenges</strong></span><br />
When Malay Muslim Khadijah married her British born, American husband (who was also of Pattan origin), she knew there would be some differences. Although her husband viewed himself as a citizen of the world &#8211; there were difficulties in settling into a marriage that was imbued with Malay culture. Adam was raised in the UK and in the Middle East, and spent time in Pakistan and then the US (New York and then Texas) and went off to Bosnia as well. “He has the directness of the Americans where he last spent his time before marrying me, the sarcasm of the Brits, the pride of the Pattans, the stubbornness of the Afghans and toughness of the Arabs.” Khadijah says her husband came across as very direct and it scared some of her friends and relatives away. A decade later, learning self-control helped him improve interpersonal relations with the locals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LJ Kolocotronis on the other hand, found that language was quite a barrier between her and her Southern Thai husband. Being American of Greek origin herself, she never dreamed of marrying someone who had grown up riding on water buffalos. “Language &#8211; it can either be fun or frustrating ,” she says. “Once, when our oldest was around two and learning how to use the potty, we were at an Islamic gathering. My son wanted to play with the apartment key and, for whatever reason, I told my husband that &#8220;Ahmad has the key.&#8221; But what he heard me say was &#8220;Ahmad has to kee.&#8221; ‘Kee’ is a Thai word that we use for having a bowel movement.” Jamilah had to ask what the hurry was when her husband rushed them back to their own apartment and put their 2 year old son on the potty! Language was also a problem for Khadijah and her foreign husband. As Adam did not have the “Westerner” look &#8211; and could pretty much gel in with the rest of Malaysians, people often started speaking in Malay to him, not realising that he was from a totally different culture, nationality and upbringing, and in general, did not speak the local language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cultural differences carry different weight for different people. While one sees a difference as small and a reason to celebrate, others seem more significant for spouses. “Adam didn’t understand why, during ‘Eid, that we had to visit family member after family member, extending all the way to uncles and aunties,” Khadijah recalls. Coming from a family of seven siblings, while her husband came from a small family of two children, was something that he had to get used to. But on the plus side, her husband was more than appreciative of the large variety of Malaysian cuisine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, LJ Kolocotronis found that not being married to someone of the same culture had led her to miss out on some historical references that were important in her culture. “My husband came to the U.S. in 1973, so his American cultural knowledge goes back pretty far, but I can&#8217;t talk about shared experiences during the 60s, with two exceptions. Those were the JFK assassination and the 1969 moon landing. Those two events were big news in Thailand too.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Long distance relationships</strong></span><br />
Besides the cultural challenges that happen locally, inter-cultural marriages sometimes translate into relationships across continents. “I do wish our two families had been able to meet each other &#8211; our parents never met,” says LJ, whose son has also married a wife of continental European origins. “We haven&#8217;t even seen two of our grandchildren. Long distance family relationships are difficult that way.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was similar for Khadijah. “When we got married, none of Adam’s relatives could make it, so the situation was kind of awkward and embarrassing for my family.” She finally met her in-laws recently, after ten years of marriage. “My late dad was also worried when we wanted to get married.” His concerns were of course well-founded as she had not met any of his family and with him being a foreigner, there would always be issues with visas and residency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Inter-cultural blessings</strong></span><br />
Despite those challenges that couples face, there is always a silver lining in inter-cultural marriages. American revert Debora, talks about her blessings: “My husband is just a really great guy with a great sense of humour. Most of his family loves me because I am the American Muslim convert who is the wife of the beloved baby of the family. All of this is such a blessing, Alhamdulillah.” On initial impressions, she says, “My family adores my husband, but they didn&#8217;t always trust him because he is an Arab, and Arab men don&#8217;t have the best reputations for treating women well.”  But their marriage single handedly changed that perception. “I think the greatest help to our marriage as far as overcoming cultural and racial differences, is time and a good sense of humour,” she adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When we married, said LJ, “We decided we would raise our kids not as either Americans or Thais, but only as Muslims. It sounded like a good idea. But our kids, now grown up, wish they&#8217;d had more of a cultural identity. We celebrated only Islamic holidays (though I did give them special desserts for the family on their birthdays) and Islam has been our reference in all things. I hope that as they get older they&#8217;ll see this as a good thing.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inter-cultural marriages are full of challenges but also full of blessings. Allah (SWT) has reminded us in Surah Ar-Rum how important love and kindness is needed to transgress boundaries of culture and language. Inter-cultural marriages are one way to do that &#8211; even if they are full of challenging moments and memories.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[When faced with frustrating circumstances, Margari Aziza Hill finds inspiration in the works of a great Muslim woman whose legacy ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living as a Muslim minority in the West, I have often not only felt frustrated by religious intolerance here, but also by intolerance from within Muslim communities which do not fully honour the rights accorded to women in Islam nor provide many outlets for women to become scholars. This was also the case in late 18th century West Africa, in what is now modern day Northern Nigeria, when Uthman Dan Fodio criticised oppressive customs and encouraged female education. Nana Asma’u bint Uthman Dan Fodio (1793-1864) was a product of her father’s commitment to quality Islamic education for women. She became a legend in her own right, and through her writings and education movement, Yan Taru, she has inspired countless women for generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Nigerian with dual American and British citizenship, researcher Rukayat Modupe Yakub is well aware of the legacy of Nana Asma’u. Rukayat points outs, “For so many Muslims, Nana Asma&#8217;u is still unknown, but for those who are familiar with her she was an educator, writer and poet who was passionate about education. For this reason you find schools in places like Nigeria named after her.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to her poetry and education movement, Nana Asm’au is also considered an Islamic leader who was known for her ability to mediate political disagreements. She was fluent in Arabic, Hausa, and the Tamasheq language of the Tuareg. Like her father and brothers, Muhammad Bello and Abdullahi, Nana Asma’u was a prolific writer who left a tremendous literary legacy. She wrote to keep her father’s memory alive in the minds of the people and in support of her brother Muhammad Bello’s Caliphate. At 27, she was given the task of organising her father’s corpus of works, all the while overseeing a household of several hundred people and ensuring that they were properly provided for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jean Boyd gained access to Nana Asma’u’s works in 1975 and later wrote <em>The Caliph’s Sister</em>, which provides a detailed biography of her life and legacy. Boyd collaborated with Beverly Mack to compile poetry and religious treatises into the <em>Collected Works of Nana Asma’u, Daughter of Usman dan Fodio (1793-1864)</em>. The book compiles her impressive body of poems and treatises in Arabic, the Fula language, and Hausa. Mack and Boyd also co-wrote a book which analyses the social and political function of many of her poems titled <em>One Woman’s Jihad: Nana Asma’u, Scholar and Scribe</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rukayat says that Nana Asma’u continues to serve as an important inspiration because “She was involved in social work and had political clout, she was a mother and wife, sister of the head of state, daughter of a legendary political and spiritual leader; she could have had any life she wanted, but she chose to be of service.” Around 1830, Nana Asma’u trained a group of women to travel around the Sokoto Caliphate to educate other women. Each woman in this cadre held the title ‘jaji’ (leader of the caravan) to designate their role as female leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One hundred and eighty years later, Dylia bin Hamadi Camara is one such jaji who explains, “We have the name of all the jajis before me so mine comes after a long line of the unbroken chain of scholarship and service to women, children and the Ummah at large.” Jaji Dylia explains that the methodology of learning that Nana Asma’u developed still educates men, women, and children. In the United States, the Yan Taru Education Foundation and Charitable Trust has chapters in Pennsylvania, Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and California with thirty-three women in intensive training and intensive seminars and classes which are open to the public. Teachers like Jaji Dylia travel internationally and use email, teleconferencing and text messaging to educate their students on classical Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While preparing for a trip to Guinea, Dylia stated her next goal is to translate Nana Asma’u’s teachings into French because the Francophone world has largely been unaware of this rich legacy. My hope is that we begin to learn more and more about the named and unnamed women who have been responsible for educating our Ummah. They have passed on a rich legacy, one that reminds me that even when faced with the greatest challenges, we as women can still be brilliant and provide guiding lights for others.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Timea Aya Csányi discusses the historical roots and struggles of Islam in Albania.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While thinking about countries with Muslim majorities in the Balkans, though our first thought would definitely be Bosnia Herzegovina, let us not forget about another small nation, whose modern history might be just as tough for our Muslim brothers and sisters as of Bosnia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the 2011 census, 70% of Albania&#8217;s 3.2 million inhabitants adhere to Islam. They are considered to be Sunnis, however 20% of them belong to the Bektashi Shi&#8217;a Mystics&#8217; minority, which is considered to be heretical by most mainstream Muslims. But the story gets even more complicated: even among those who declare a religion, the majority of the population has a more secular interpretation of religion compared to other countries &#8211; due to nearly 50 years of a suppressing communist regime in the country. According to Pew Research Center, Albania has the lowest percentage in the world amongst countries with significant Muslim populations, and Gallup Global Reports claims that it is the thirteenth least religious country in the world.To truly understand the situation of today&#8217;s Albanian Muslims, we need to go back to the 14th century when &#8211; unlike Slovenia &#8211; the country was occupied by the Ottoman Empire until 1912.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Conversion</strong></span><br />
With the invasion of the Ottomans, Islam entered the then Christian-majority Albania and was largely adopted in the centre and south of the country. Shortly after, the Albanian Muslim class started to play an increasingly important role in the Empire&#8217;s political and economic life, thereby attracting other Albanians to convert to Islam with the hope of taking similar positions. Besides followers of the Sunni path, another Muslim group appeared in the country through the Albanian elite infantry (janissaries) of the Ottoman army who mixed pagan rites with Islam. They belonged to the Bektashi sect which later moved their headquarters to Tirana, the capital city of Albania, after being expelled from Turkey by Atatürk in 1925.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Atheism Attacks</strong></span><br />
Not long after the country won its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, began the systematic dereligionisation of the nation under the Stalinist regime of Enver Hoxha. Thus, Islam and all other faiths in the country underwent radical changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sanctions to demolish religions in the country and then establish the world&#8217;s first ever atheist state started in 1946, when the government nationalised most property of religious institutions.They also tortured and executed clergies and believers as well. Religious institutions were forbidden to have anything to do with education; nearly 2169 churches, mosques, <em>tekkes</em> (Bektashi lodges), monasteries and other religious institutions were either closed down or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, or workshops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people&#8221; &#8211; stated an article in the Albanian Constitution of 1976 which also imposed prison sentences of three to 10 years for &#8220;religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature.&#8221; The new constitution went even further, obliging Albanians with Islamic and religiously-tinged first names to change them. Towns and villages with religious names had to be renamed as well. Individuals caught with religious objects faced long prison sentences and sometimes officials tried to entrap practising Muslims and Christians by distributing forbidden foods in school or at work; even religious weddings were prohibited. However, even though our Albanian brothers and sisters suffered a great deal and were exposed to numerous dangers, many of them kept practising their religion in secret.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union and the death of Hoxha, the ban on religious observance was officially lifted in 1990. However, 50 years of such immense oppression did have a negative impact on the community, along with the tragic economic situation and huge lack of basic food supplies which followed the collapse of communism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Reversion</strong></span><br />
With the help of Islamic organisations, coming largely from the Arab peninsula, the young generation has begun to discover religion for the first time &#8211; via schools and mosques established by foreign charities. The phenomenon has been criticised by fellow Muslims who see these &#8220;imported&#8221; Islamic thoughts, which they call &#8220;Salafism&#8221; and &#8220;Wahabism&#8221;, as culturally alien; therefore tension has been created between the so-called young &#8216;Arab&#8217; Albanians and their elder &#8216;Turkish&#8217; Albanians. Making further steps towards solving this issue in 2011, Bedër University, Albania&#8217;s first Islamic university was opened in Tirana &#8220;to put an end to the import-export of theological students with the Arab countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>PLACES TO SEE:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>1. Et&#8217;hem Bey Mosque in Tirana (Xhamia e Et&#8217;hem Beut)</strong></span><br />
Of the approximately 800 mosques found in Albania, if you&#8217;d need to choose only one to visit, Et&#8217;hem Bey Mosque should be the one. When visiting Tirana, you cannot even miss this pretty mosque as it is located right on the capital city&#8217;s main square. The construction started in 1794 and was finished in 1821 by Et&#8217;hem Bey. It was closed under communist rule, but reopened as a house of worship in 1991 without permission from the authorities. The event was actually a milestone in the country&#8217;s rebirth of religious freedom with 10,000 courageous attendants and remarkably the police did not interfere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>2. King Mosque (Xhamia Mbret)</strong></span><br />
Being Albania&#8217;s oldest mosque, King Mosque was built in 1380 in the town of Berat by Bayezid II Sultanat at the time the Ottoman Empire began setting its sights on Albania. In 1948, it gained the title of Cultural Monument, recognised by the government of Albania and the ministry of culture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>3. Tanners&#8217; Bridge (Ura e tabakëve)</strong></span><br />
This Ottoman stone footbridge served once as the main connection between Tirana and the highlands to the east across the Lana River. When the river was rerouted in the 1930s, the bridge was eventually neglected, but has been restored to its former glory and is used by pedestrians again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0088d6;">The very tree which witnessed a life-changing incident for the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) stands today as a living testimonial to the interfaith and nature-revering roots of Islam.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 1,400 years ago, under the shade of a tree in the Arabian desert, a Christian hermit monk named Bahira became the first person to recognise the young Prophet Muhammad (SAW) as the Prophet for the end of time. Today, that tree stands isolated in the depths of the Jordanian desert as the only living witness to the Prophet Muhammad (SAW). A beautiful film has now been produced charting the importance of that tree as well as its discovery years after the incident. Titled &#8216;The Blessed Tree,&#8217; it charts the journey of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) with his uncle Abu Talib (RA) across the Arabian desert to modern-day Syria for trade. The caravan is believed to have weaved its way across what is now Jordan and made a stop at the residence of the Christian monk, Bahira.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to several accounts, the monk Bahira saw a cloud shielding somebody amongst the caravan&#8217;s members and when they reached the tree, it passed along this duty of providing shade to the tree. The monk sensed the important presence of a spiritual leader amongst the visitors and was eager to meet them all and set his eyes on the person the cloud was shielding. After meeting everyone on the caravan, he asked whether there was anybody else &#8211; he didn&#8217;t feel a great spiritual connection with any of them and so still felt something was missing. They replied that there wasn’t anyone else  and then they remembered that they had a left a young boy to care for the animals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bahira insisted on meeting the young boy, who was a young, pre-prophethood Muhammad (SAW), and then asked who he was. Abu Talib (RA) replied that it was his son. Bahira responded that this couldn&#8217;t be so as this boy&#8217;s father was no longer alive. Abu Talib (RA) was shocked and asked Bahira how he could possibly have known this and the monk simply responded by telling him to watch over the boy and protect him from his enemies for he would be the prophet to come at the end of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The amazing thing about this important meeting, which foretold the Prophet&#8217;s (SAW) amazing future, is that the tree is still alive today. The very tree which witnessed the life-changing incident still stands as a living testimonial to interfaith and nature-revering roots of Islam. Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad of Jordan relates that on his return from studying at Cambridge, his late uncle, King Hussein, put him to work in the Royal Archives. It was there that researchers discovered numerous references to the tree in a forgotten inventory of the holy sites in Jordan made by King Abdullah I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Indeed, the film has beautiful footage of the Jordanian desert where the tree is located as well as interviews with some of the most famous Islamic scholars of our time. They explore important themes such as the shade of the cloud and tree as a symbol of mercy and protection &#8211; which reflects the Prophet&#8217;s (SAW) role as an interceder at the end of time when he will ask Allah (SWT) for forgiveness for his followers and indeed all the people of mankind. Renowned scholars such as Abdal Hakim Murad, Prof. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, the Grand Mufti of Egypt Ali Jum’a, Muhammad Ramadan Al-Buti, Al-Habib ‘Umar bin Hafeeth and Al-Habib Ali al-Jifri are all in the film and the majority were able to visit the tree and to convey their immediate reaction to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof. Seyyed Hossein Nasr is particularly interested in the relevance of the tree today and what we can learn from it spiritually. &#8220;There is, in a sense, a vertical dimension that goes through our heart vertically through our head and up to Heaven. The line of transcendence. This is the inner tree,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The roots of it are actually the roots of the Divine reality in our hearts. For most human beings this tree has dried up because they are not aware of its roots. It is virtually there but not actually; and the spiritual life means the reviving of this tree within us by sinking the roots of the Divine once again in our hearts.” Shaykh Hamza Yusuf is also eager to point out that the tree itself plays an important role in reviving our spiritual life. &#8220;The Blessed Tree has a fruit, the seed of which plants a new branch of iman (faith) in the heart. I literally felt my iman increase while watching this film. There are parts which would reduce even the hardest of hearts to tears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is undoubtable that the blessed tree could play a hugely positive role in the Islamic ummah and raise our awareness of the importance of nature and the interconnected histories of all the Abrahamic faiths. At a time when we all seem to be at odds with each other and struggling to increase our faith, it is startling that a solitary pistachio tree could offer us so much.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Klaudia Khan reveals the problem of light pollution from a Muslim point of view.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know those amazing pictures of the night sky studded with thousands of stars and the Milky Way clearly visible? Subhan Allah, they are beautiful. But have you ever actually seen the sky like that? If you live in a city, or even a small town the chances are that you haven’t. I can honestly say that I have never seen the Milky Way. But I hope to be able to see it one day, insha Allah, if I manage to travel somewhere wild and unspoilt and free from light pollution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we think of pollution we imagine dirty stuff contaminating water, soil or the air. But how can light be polluting? It’s not even a substance, but some kind of electromagnetic wave, as modern physics defines it, so how it could cause problems? Unfortunately, light pollution is too often taken lightly, but it’s a serious problem. And especially so for Muslims. Let me explain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Light pollution is defined as excessive, misdirected, or obtrusive artificial (usually outdoor) light. (<a href="http://www.globeatnight.org/light-pollution.php">http://www.globeatnight.org/light-pollution.php</a>) It is a new thing: the by-product of civilizations powered by electricity. Just imagine, some hundred years ago there was no street lighting and no illuminated signs and no light seeping from the windows of the houses. How dark it must have been! Nowadays people living in urban areas do not even experience such darkness. And they are missing out on the amazing signs in the sky above their heads! But light pollution also has some more serious consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Qur’an we are reminded time after time of the importance of the circadian rhythm: <em><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>“And it is He Who gives life and causes death, and His is the alternation of night and day. Will you not then understand?”</strong></span> <span style="color: #999999;">(Al-Muminoon :80)</span></em> The succession of day and night is one of the signs of Allah (SWT) and the natural pattern of light and dark is crucial for the Earth’s ecosystems. Owls are not the only creatures which wake at dusk and even flowers follow the sunlight and close for the night. Light pollution disrupts the delicate balance of ecosystems and negatively affects nocturnal wildlife, both plants and animals. Artificial light can: confuse the migratory patterns of birds and other animals (each year in New York City alone, about 10,000 migratory birds are injured or killed crashing into lighted skyscrapers and high-rise buildings); alter competitive interactions of animals, as some animals only forage in the dark; change predator-prey relations, where predators are more likely to see nocturnal animals that used to be hidden in the dark and even cause physiological harm. Plants are affected too: strong-scented flowers are generally pollinated at night, but if the darkness does not come, neither do the pollinators who are normally active in the dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By disrupting the ecosystems, light pollution affects humans as well: if the plants don’t get pollinated they won’t bear fruit, and if some animals don’t reproduce due to lack of darkness, then it may cause the decline or escalation in populations of other species. But the upset in the balance of day and night has an even more direct impact on us. The most obvious consequence is sleep disorders, such as delayed sleep–phase syndrome, in which people tend to fall asleep very late at night and have difficulty waking up in time for work, school, or social engagements. (Environmental Health Perspectives Journal:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627884/"> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627884/</a>) This could explain why we find it so hard to wake up for Fajr prayer, but it is certainly no excuse to miss it. Some researchers suggest a link between excessive exposure to artificial light and breast cancer. According to the Chronobiology Journal (Jan 2008) “women living in neighbourhoods where it was bright enough to read a book outside at midnight had a 73% higher risk of developing breast cancer than those residing in areas with the least outdoor artificial lighting.” The suspected link is melatonin, a hormone known for helping to regulate the body’s biological clock. Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and secreted at night; melatonin levels drop sharply in the presence of artificial or natural light. Scientists admit that the health consequences of light pollution are yet largely unknown, but the research on this subject is slow, as the problem of light pollution is often disregarded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modern way of life disassociated from the natural rhythm of day and night is not only unhealthy, but it also goes against the teaching of Islam. <em><strong><span style="color: #333399;">“See they not that We have made the night for them to rest therein, and the day sight-giving? Verily, in this are signs for the people who believe.”</span></strong> <span style="color: #999999;">(An-Naml :86)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our worship is scheduled by the rhythm of night and day and by the lunar calendar. The two important prayers, Fajr, offered at second dawn, and ‘Isha, offered at night, require the measuring of the amount of twilight, which is caused by the scattering of sunlight by the upper layers of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. But nowadays light pollution makes it hard to identify nautical twilight and for this reason leading Islamic organizations endorse the beginning and end of night (‘Isha) prayer when the Sun is geometrically approximately 18° at sea level that is, the point of astronomical twilight. Modern technology may help determine the prayer times, but it won’t be of much use when it comes to looking for the Ramadhan and Eid moon, as it has to be observed with the naked eye, and light pollution makes it much harder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Light pollution is certainly at its worst over the biggest cities and many observers claim that the worst of them all is Dubai. “Does it mean the end of Arabian nights?” – asks Brian Nitz on the Green Prophet website. It is a cynical joke of his: “Imagine if One Thousand and One Arabian Nights had ended on the third page with king Shahryar telling Scheherazade: “The sun has risen.  I must fulfill my oath and execute my wife before she betrays me.” And Scheherazade replies with her final words, “But master, that is not the sunrise. It is merely the lights of a new shopping center.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Light pollution is not to be taken lightly: it is a big problem with big consequences the scope of which we probably cannot even fully imagine. So can we do anything about it? We have neither the power nor the authority to turn off the lights of the big bright cities&#8230; But to make a big difference we have to start with small changes: turn off the light in your bedroom, in your house, campaign to reduce the amount of lighting on your street and in your neighbourhood. And most importantly of all spread the awareness of the problem – shed the light of knowledge.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Umm-e-Ismaeel draws some enticing reasons to wander away from the big city of Dubai and over to its quaint sister-city - Sharjah.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Madam, this is 75 Dirhams, it’s hand-crafted,” explained the friendly Filipino lady as I tried on a silver ring with a flower motif and tiny aquamarine stones set on the petals of the flower. Rose runs a kiosk, one of several scattered throughout Souq Al Arsah. She makes and sells jewellry  – most of it silver with semi-precious stones. “I learned the craft from a Yemeni man here. He also makes and sells,” smiled Rose. “We buy the stones from Yemen and Kuwait.” Other than jewellry, Rose sells souvenirs such as magnets and glass pieces shaped as camels and famous buildings of Dubai. I bought a round, cornflower blue magnet picturing Burj Al Arab hotel for five Dirhams. Similar magnets cost 12-15 Dirhams in Dubai.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Souq Al Arsah is Sharjah’s oldest market, renovated by the Sharjah government and converted into an indoor, air-conditioned souq for a smooth and comfortable shopping experience.  ‘Arsah’ in Arabic means ‘courtyard’. Not many people are familiar with Sharjah, sister city to glitzy Dubai and third largest emirate of the United Arab Emirates. Boasting more than twenty museums and an array of souqs, Sharjah lives up to the title bestowed on it in 1998 by UNESCO as the “cultural capital of the Arab world.” The market’s architecture evokes the magic of the Arabian Nights. Gothic arches, wooden latticed balconies, oil lanterns hanging on walls, wooden shop doors and beamed ceilings – all radiate old world charm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I arrived at Souq Al Arsah at 10 o’clock in the morning, when the place is mostly empty – a good move, since merchants bargain easily with fewer customers around. To attract customers, shopkeepers display some merchandise outside their shops. An ethnic silver jewellry set with jade, citrine, turquoise, amber, and other colourful stones hung outside one shop, which also sells a variety of traditional daggers. Another sells local handicrafts like woven wall hangings, silver-plated mirrors, parchment scrolls inscribed with verses from the Qur’an, and multihued, painted electric and oil lanterns, some decorated with mosaic tiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Al Saeedi Bamboo Products sells hand-woven bamboo baskets flecked with orange diamond patterns, coasters, and placemats. Handmade silk carpets, paintings by local artists, and books on Islam are also sold in the souq.  I spotted a cotton tunic, embroidered in typical multi-coloured Kashmiri chain stitch, hanging outside a shop selling textiles from India. The rich velvet cushion covers, beaded and sequined pashmina shawls and Benarsi silk table runners drew me in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all souqs, bargaining is the unspoken rule, and I plunged right in. A fuchsia and mint green, 1m-by-1m velvet and silk throw embellished with sequins, round mirrors, glass and wooden beads and tassels, cost 60 Dirhams. Original price  – 125 Dirhams. I also bought a curved dagger with a wooden handle  – the scabbard decorated with animal hide and engraved silver  – reducing the price from 70 Dirhams to 30 Dirhams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another kiosk operated by a bearded man had rosaries for the spiritually inclined, which sparkled as the sunlight hit them. Some are crafted here, while others are imported from different countries of the Gulf and Southeast Asia. He had a large selection  – plastic, glass, wooden, and semi-precious stone  – ranging from 15 Dirhams to some well over 200 Dirhams. Some of the pricey ones included garnet beads, locally known as aqeeq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tantalising aroma of hot coffee reached me as I made my way to the coffee shop, which sells an assortment of sandwiches and drinks. As I headed home in the evening, I felt like Ali Baba from <em>The Thousand and One Nights</em>, gleefully emerging from the cave, arms laden with treasures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marriage -two human souls uniting in a lifelong union under the auspices of Allah (SWT) Almighty &#8211; can be a precarious affair for even the most closely-matched couple. So how much more precarious can it be when cultural difference enters the equation? With so many Muslims in the West choosing to marry outside their racial or cultural group, it is clear that intercultural marriages are here to stay. But how do Muslims negotiate the many issues that arise while navigating the waters, not just of married life, but cultural differences?</p>

<p><span style="color: #9e0505;"><strong>Guess who’s coming to dinner?</strong></span></p>
<p>As Muslim marriages are often a union of two families, rather than just two individuals, intercultural marriages are bound to cause conflict, particularly in cultures where marriages tend to take place within the cultural or family group. Meeting prospective in-laws for the first time can be especially daunting. Anisa, a sister from Indonesia, re- calls her parent’s disapproval of her choice of American spouse. Fortunately, she found an ally in her sister who had studied in the United States and helped convince her Indonesian parents that Americans were “also good people”. Her marriage to her husband also caused disharmony between her and her in-laws. They suspected that she was only interested in a green-card.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Candice, an African American revert, also experienced the first tremors of disharmony when she learned that her father preferred her to marry an African American over the Columbian man she had in mind. Similarly, her prospective in-laws preferred a South American daughter-in-law. How- ever, she is happy to say that there are no obstacles now:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, not all couples get off on the wrong foot with their families. Umm Ibrahim, Canadian born and raised, had no qualms about introducing her prospective spouse to her family. A product of a cross-cultural marriage herself, her Jewish mum and English dad was very accepting of her Somali husband. On the other hand, Fatma, recalls her wedding day without even a “congratulations” from her mother, who refused to understand her acceptance of Islam, let alone her Indian husband. Keeping the faith can change any initial apprehensions about cross-cultural marriages. Thirteen years and four children later, Anisa finds that her American in-laws love and appreciate her the same way her parents love and appreciate her husband.</p>

<p><span style="color: #9e0505;"><strong>The intrigue of diversity</strong></span></p>
<p>As with all marriages, intercultural ones have their share of joyous and blissful times. When times are good, they are very good. “For me I find life has been more exciting and interesting,” says Laurie Hammond Aly, an American Muslimah living in Ohio, USA, who has been married to her Egyptian husband for the past 10 years. “I am still learning new things about my husband and his culture all the time and it is like a never ending ride!” she shares. Laurie also likes the fact that her children are being raised in two different cultures, which helps them to appreciate life a lot more than if they were exposed to only one culture. “My marriage has<br />
made me a better person by expanding my mind to undestand a better way of life. It has made me work to better myself,” she says.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Umm Hasna, a Moroccan raised in West London, shares Laurie’s enthusiasm for being in a multicultural family. “My husband’s family are from Jamaica and Panama and I enjoy being married to someone different,” she says. “Since I married him, I feel my eyes have really opened as my upbringing was quite narrow: everything and everyone was Moroccan! Now, we try to share each other’s cultures.” Also, Umm Hasna ensures that her children continue to experience aspects of their Moroccan heritage, including eating Moroccan food and having a traditional Moroccan bath once a week!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>Fiza Atif, a Canadian Muslimah who resides in Kuwait and is a newly married to a Kuwaiti appreciates the fact that her husband has a stronger sense of family than what is typical in the West. “My husband’s concept of family responsi- bility and familial relationships is different than what I grew up with which binds us closer.” Specifically, in the Kuwaiti culture, Fiza feels that children are cherished more than in her homeland, where she was a single mother. “My husband has made it possible for me to pursue my career, stay home with my children and has given me choices that neither my children nor I would have had living in Canada on our own,” Fiza reflects. “He was open, humorous and loving with my children right from the start which brought closeness between him and them.”</p>

<p><span style="color: #9e0505;"><strong>The challenges of difference</strong></span></p>
<p>All marriages face rough patches, which can really add unwanted stress in a relationship. But with intercultural- marriages there can be some unexpected facets that make married life just a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section">

<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Laurie, the biggest challenge she has faced in her marriage is with the role of spouses. “If the husband comes from a home where the woman does all the work and the wife comes from a home where men pitch in, there will definitely be conflict,” says Laurie. She still often gets upset when she has to carry the burden of household chores alone, which is not something her own mother had to do. Laurie often saw her own father helping her mother with the most mundane household work. In addition to the roles of spouses, Laurie says that the most painful aspect of her marriage is dealing with her non-Muslim family. “It’s hard trying to make them happy and my husband happy at the same time. They do not understand his cultural views, but I do. I often find that I am always stuck in the middle,” she laments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>The biggest challenge in Fiza’s marriage is dealing with misunderstandings and language barriers. “It was I who came into my husband’s country and so I had to learn to adapt. I had to learn what was culturally acceptable and what wasn’t,” she shares. Fiza firmly believes that wherever a person spends the first 20 years of their life then that is who they are. “My husband is a Kuwaiti,” Fiza quietly reflects. She also wrestles with language barriers in her marriage that sometimes makes communicating with her husband difficult. “Even though my husband speaks excellent English, it is not his first language. He lacks the words to express himself the way he’d like to sometimes which frustrates him and can make whatever situation worse,” she says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 22">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>This is possibly the biggest challenge within intercultural marriages: the communication barrier. Not only language, but expressions, gestures and even emotions can be misunderstood and misinterpreted when cultural backgrounds differ. Umm Hasna cites her husband’s incomprehension of her desire to return to Morocco as an example of this. “When I was growing up,” she says, “we went back to Morocco once a year. I haven’t been back now for over 5 years and I miss it terribly. I have also wanted that for my children but my husband doesn’t understand. For him, it’s just not a priority.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>There are additional challenges, according to Umm Hasna. “I speak Moroccan Arabic; my husband doesn’t, so we use English around the house. But that means that my children can’t speak Arabic and that really bothers me. “Another substantial difference is food,” says Candice. “I love spicy food!” Her refusal to cook with “less pepper” has converted her Colombian husband to the extent that, now, he complains when dinner is not hot enough. Umm Hasna has also got her husband hooked on Moroccan food while learning a few West Indian specialities to keep things exciting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #9e0505;"><strong>Recipe for success?</strong></span></p>
<p>While cultural differences may be a factor for some couples, there is absolutely no reason why they have to define whether a marriage will succeed or fail. There are a lot of things that both spouses can do to help make the marriage work. Specifically, advises Laurie, couples can do a lot of talking before the wedding ceremony even takes place to find out what each other’s expectations are before the union. “Make sure you are a person who does not mind change because if you are entering a new culture you will face a lot of it,” she says. “And make sure your prospective spouse understands your culture and will accept you for who you are since you will both be working through the challenges of marriage together.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<div class="page" title="Page 22">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Umm Hasna advises: “If you have strong roots, speak to your husband before marriage so that he is aware of how you feel. If returning to your homeland every year is important to you, tell him. Be clear from the beginning.” But Umm Hasna is equally adamant that Islam should be at the heart of any Muslim marriage, regardless of whether the spouses share a single culture. “For my family, Islam has become our way of life and that is what we pass onto the children. Cultural variety is a bonus, but the deen is the foundation.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiza believes the best way for any marriage to work is if both spouses hone their communication skills. “A couple must learn to communicate effectively. You must learn to handle each other during times of stress, frustration, anger and hurt feelings. Learn which approach is best and what works to calm each other,” she advises. Fiza also recognizes that many cultures are more traditional than in the West. “My mom likens my marriage to one in the 1950’s and she is probably right,” she says, “It takes a lot of patience to learn a man and his culture. But remember: knowledge is power.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being able to bring two cultures together in harmony is something that the great nations of the world fail to do every single day. But between married couples where love most certainly resides, irrespective of whether the measure is large or small, two cultures can intertwine in a seamless bond of affection that will last throughout a lifetime. All it takes is a little patience, openness and loving compromise to create a loving multicultural Muslim home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em><span style="color: #9c770b;">You’re asking if I have I ever wanted to write a novel?</span></em></strong><br />
Is that a silly question? I guess there a very few people who haven’t fantasised about writing a novel and becoming an international bestselling author overnight.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I’m not talking about fantasies here; I want to know if you have ever had a story you felt the need to write, a story that has haunted you for years. A story that has developed in your mind day by day whilst you’re showering, washing the dishes or trying to sleep, to the extent that you may even have a full set of characters with various meandering and interconnecting storylines (I can’t be the only one wondering if all voices in the head are bad). I’m asking whether there is a story you feel is missing in everything you have already read and that you wish someone would write. As the Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winning author Toni Morrison has said: “If there&#8217;s a book that you want to read, but it hasn&#8217;t been written yet, then you must write it.”<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #9c770b;"><em><strong>Well, now that you mention it, there is this one story that I’ve wanted to write for a long time, but who has the time to write a novel? Isn’t that a self-indulgent thing to do?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Why should we not be self-indulgent once in a while? More often than not, as women, we give so much of ourselves to our loved ones &#8211; our husbands, our children, our families &#8211; putting aside all our own dreams to cheer on everyone else. Fulfilling our own dreams does not mean we will neglect those who have rights over us. Would it be so terrible if say, out of the twelve months we give to others, we took out one month to ourselves?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #9c770b;"><em><strong>Okay, you have a point. But why do I need to write? Because if I’m just trying to be self-indulgent, there are other things I’d like to do. Like taking a one way ticket to the Maldives.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Writing is not an act of self-indulgence. Far too often, books are seen as a frivolous pastime in Muslim communities and separate from our deen. But I agree with Jill Jepson who argues that “to write in service of a good cause is to offer the world a great and wonderful gift” and that “few forms of charity are as profound and long lasting as that of a writer who exposes social injustices and encourages others to do good works”.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
There has never been a more important time for Muslim women to write: we are constantly exploited in the media, stereotyped and victimised. Yet the world is becoming more globalised day by day, helping us find ways to reach out to the rest of the world and reclaim our voices. There has never been a greater need for more diverse literature, for ourselves, for our children, for the generations to come. Let’s start telling our own stories.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If you have a story, you must write it. And NaNoWriMo is the best place to start.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong><span style="color: #9c770b;">Gosh, I never thought of it in that way! Sorry, what’s this NaNoWriMo thing?</span></strong></em></p>
<p>National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo for short, or NaNo for shorter (ridiculous name, I know, but it pretty much sums up the zaniness of this endeavour) is “a fun, seat-of-your-pants approach to creative writing” where participants from all over the world aim to write a 50,000 word novel over the month of November. You just sign up and start writing &#8211; it’s as simple as that. You can track your progress, get lots of pep talks and support, and you meet lots of fellow writers from all over the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #9c770b;">50,000 words in a month? That sounds absurd.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>No, no it’s not! It’s only 1, 667 words a day, really.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Ernest Hemingway comes to mind: “There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
NaNo is basically like bleeding out every ounce of creativity you’ve hoarded in your body for the past year or likely more. And thousands of people are doing it together, cheering each other on and competing with who can bleed the most in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It’s work, but of the ridiculously fun variety. How many people can say they have written a novel in 30 days? If you were to take just one month for yourself each year, ignored the chores, let your husband deal with the tantrumming toddlers, spent less time preparing food each day &#8211; you could possibly write a novel Every. Single. Year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #9c770b;">You’re not exactly selling this to me. You just sound masochistic.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Ha! I know it sounds difficult and a tad masochistic but as Hemingway points out, that is true of writing anyway. A fellow NaNo-er, Sazida Desai, made a brilliant analogy comparing NaNoWriMo to Ramadhan: “before it starts, there is a whole lot of apprehension about how you’re going to survive the whole month with a load of changed priorities”. Like Ramadhan, we are both excited and terrified about the endeavour, but what makes the ride so much easier is “the spirit of unity and togetherness with writers across the globe, who are going through exactly the same challenges right there with you every day”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
You might be writing on your own but you will never be on your own in the NaNo community &#8211; we will cheer you on, congratulate you on good days, pull you back up on bad days. As long as you keep connected, the support you’ll receive is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The best part of the month is what we, The Muslimah NaNo Team, dubbed ‘Word Warring’, more officially known as ‘NaNo Sprints’ by general NaNo-ers. In our Facebook group, we compete with each other to write as many words as we can in a set amount of time, ranging from 5 to 40 minutes. There was some hot competition last year. Not only did we often easily reach our daily word counts each day, but we also had fun. As Saba N Taylor said to me: “Writing is much easier when you&#8217;re having fun”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #9c770b;">I can see how that could be fun! But it also seems like one heck of a journey! Is it even doable?</span></em></strong><br />
What if I told you that a bunch of us from the SISTERS community &#8211; including full-time working sisters, wives to attention-seeking men and children alike (ha!) &#8211; managed to hit the 50,000 target? Although last year was not my first year of NaNo, it was my first year of keeping connected to other NaNo-ers and also the first time I won. Many others also won, some for the second or third time running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if that isn’t inspiring enough, Karimah Grayson not only won NaNoWriMo but went on to spend this year editing her novel and successfully self-published it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #9c770b;">That’s given me butterflies! But where does one even start writing a novel?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Starting is probably the hardest part of NaNoWriMo. Janet Kozak has expressed the importance of getting a good start, much like a short distance sprint: “[you need] to get going and pumped from the minute the whistle blows”.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Many don’t plan before starting on November 1st, but it can make a huge difference to your first week if you spend some time in October figuring out the plot, the characters, the structure, and the different storylines. That’s not to say you won’t get stuck during the month, but a good plan will definitely help you build a strong foundation in the beginning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #9c770b;">Any other advice for newbie NaNo-ers? (gosh, I am using NaNo lingo already!)</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Oh, that’s when you know you are converted NaNo-er!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My best piece of advice would be: don’t do it on your own! Moral support is extremely important to keep you going, so take to Twitter, join Facebook groups, make use of the forums on the website. And also find yourself a non-virtual cheerleader, someone who asks about your word count each day, gives you a pat on the back &#8211; maybe  a hand massage, makes you a cup of tea (bakes you a cake, perhaps?) as you spill away at your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Remember that the most important thing during NaNoWriMo is word count. So forget everything you hold dear in regards to punctuation and grammar and just write. Don’t correct typos, don’t check spelling, forget paragraphs and don’t even bother with speech marks. Get it written. Let your fingers type as fast as they can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Also, spend 5-10 minutes at the beginning or end of the day planning your next writing session, it’ll mean you won’t be sitting there staring at blank screen. Remember, you don’t need to write chronologically: if you get stuck or bored, you can move on to more exciting scenes later in the novel, or even go back and flesh out other scenes you’ve already written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Just keep writing &#8211; don’t delete, don’t proofread, just let it all out. You can figure out structure and shortlist scenes during the editing process that begins after November. NaNoWriMo is all about letting your raw creativity loose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #9c770b;">You’ve actually got me excited now! So where does all the fun stuff like Word Warring and NaNo cheerleading happen?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>There’s lots of support and sprinting over on Twitter on both the NaNoWriMo accounts as well as the MuslimWomenNaNo account. The best fun, however, is to be had on our Facebook page for Muslim NaNo-ers &#8211; it’s basically a virtual literary boot camp.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
But of course, you have to learn the NaNoWriMo cheer before you can join: “N – A – N – O / NaNo-ers let’s go! / Let me hear you say GO! / Lets write! Fight! Unite! (Did you just make that up?) Terrible isn’t it? I should stick to writing fiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
On a more serious note, I truly believe that if you have been blessed with the desire to write, then it is your duty to use that gift for benefit of the Ummah. The world needs your stories. And we can make it fun. Sign up, bring your notebooks, pens, laptops, mugs of tea and plenty of cake &#8211; and let the NaNo-ing begin!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Timea Csanyi gives an overview of the introduction of Islam to Bosnia-Herzegovina up to the climate for today’s Bosniaks.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hearing the word &#8216;European Muslims&#8217;, the first thing that usually comes to mind is the Muslims of the West: immigrants with Muslim backgrounds or white Western converts. But there is another side to Europe which has much more to do with Islam than we would first think. And that is the reason I decided to dig into the history of Eastern Europe to discover its forgotten treasures of the past and the challenging present of our brothers and sisters living in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bosnia-Herzegovina is one of the most diverse countries of former Yugoslavia where Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Serbs and Croats are living together more or less peacefully. Bosnia covers the north and centre of the country with its name probably derived from &#8216;bosana&#8217;, an old Indo-European word meaning water, which Bosnia has no shortage of. The southern region of ancient Hum was later named Herzegovina after the occupation of the Ottomans. With the diversity of nationalities comes the maelstrom of religions too; today, from the 4 million of its inhabitants, 40% are Muslims, 31% are Orthodox Christians, 15% are Roman Catholic and 14% others, including Jews who arrived in the late 15th century after being expelled from Spain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muslim tribes have been present in Eastern Europe since early times, but the turning point in Bosnia came with the &#8220;invasion&#8221; of the Ottoman Empire which lasted in the country for 400 years. The word invasion is usually coupled with negative impacts; however, in the situation of Bosnia, the Ottoman occupation proved the contrary. From 1463 to 1878, Bosnia-Herzegovina experienced a prolonged period of general welfare and prosperity. Ottomans allowed for the preservation of Bosnia&#8217;s identity; moreover, the country was an integral province of the empire with its historical name and territorial integrity. During the 16th century, the economic and cultural life rapidly developed; so much so that the capital city of Sarajevo today is one of the few European cities that has had a water supply system for more than 400 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrary to what we might study at Western schools, the Ottoman Empire did not force people to convert to Islam; tolerance of other religious creeds was actually one of the distinctive features of Ottoman rule. Eventually, the local native Slavic-speaking Muslim community grew into the largest ethno-religious group of the country with 67% of the population in the early 1600s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ottomans were followed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the late 17th century, who swept away ideas about a multi-faith Bosnian nation by seeding waves of nationalism, leading to the ominous event in Sarajevo which eventually caused WW1. Bosnia and Albania were the only parts of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans where large numbers of people had converted to Islam and remained there after independence in 1992. But that independence was dearly paid for; in the Yugoslav civil war (1991-1999), the three-year Bosnian war was one of the bloodiest parts in which 97,000 people lost their lives, mainly by the Serbian army. 83% of the victims were Muslims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neila Muratovic and her mother lived in a Muslim-majority small town of Bosnia during the war. She says it felt safe inside, unlike the city of Srebrenica, for instance, where the Serbian army massacred 8,000 Muslim men in 1995. The Serbs surrounded Neila&#8217;s area which made it impossible to leave or approach the city. This led to a lack of food supplies which could only come by airplanes, dropping food to the people below, or by the help of the Croatian church. &#8220;No one thought this could ever happen&#8221;, Neila says. &#8220;We, the average people, lived in peace with Serbs and Croats before.&#8221; Another sister, Maida Halilovic, adds that Serbs could not enter the village they lived in, but they sent special helicopters instead to bombard their homes. During the attack, her father would take her in his arms and go to the mountains to hide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost 15 years after the war, things are getting better; young people are less familiar with what happened in the past, but hatred towards Muslims has not disappeared completely from many areas in the country. Nevertheless, Neila proudly wears the hijab unlike many other Muslim girls, particularly in Sarajevo. Neila reflects on being a Muslim in Bosnia: &#8220;The communist ideology brainwashed the people, including Muslims. Therefore, today&#8217;s Bosniak community is quite mixed with religious, practicing Muslims and Muslims who are highly influenced by the Western European lifestyle. However, we have Islamic studies as subject in all schools with the opportunity to learn the Arabic or the Turkish language. We have Islamic high schools and children are regularly brought to the mosque. Sad, but I feel here in Germany, where I currently live, that I see more women with hijab than in my home country, let alone niqab which you barely see there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>HISTORICAL SITES</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #333399;"> <strong>Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque (Begova Dzamija)</strong></span><br />
Considered to be the most important Islamic structure in the country, the mosque is the largest and most visited Islamic building in the Balkan region and was originally built by the Ottomans in 1531. The main architect and financier of the mosque, Gazi Husrev-beg, wrote in his memoirs: “I built the mosques, the bridges, the inns for travellers and my vakuf (charity) is the finest that will ever be known. They will say, in the time to come, that Gazi Husref-beg turned Sarajevo village into Sarajevo town.&#8221; During the Bosnian war, the mosque was heavily damaged, but in 1996 it was renovated with Saudi and Syrian help, which architects claim caused it to lose its unique features. The interior was decorated intricately with complex colours; however, today most walls are purely white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Old Bridge (Stari Most)</strong></span><br />
The bridge, which stands in the city of Mostar crossing the river Neretva, is one of the country&#8217;s most recognisable landmarks and also considered one of the most outstanding pieces of Islamic architecture in the area. The original bridge was built by Ottoman sultan Suleiman I. in the 16th century (1567). During the war, the bridge was deliberately destroyed, but with the help of UNESCO and other additional funding, it was reconstructed in 2004 as a World Heritage site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Ferhat Pasha Mosque</strong></span><br />
Situated in the city of Banja Luka, the mosque is one of the greatest examples of the 16th century classical Ottoman architecture. Though it was one of the 16 destroyed in the city during the Bosnian war in 1993 by the Serbian Republic, it is currently being rebuilt.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Rafeeah Laher learns the backstory of the internationally coordinated ‘Raising Smiles’ organisation.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zeina Al-Khalaf, an ambitious young girl from the USA, embarked on a mission to bring change to kids halfway across the globe by starting her own non-profit charity organisation while she was still just in high school. The lives of Ahmed Jabbar, an Iraqi child who had lost his legs, had minimal eyesight and 70 percent of his body burned, and Dalal Nassir, a 5 year old girl also with severe wounds, brought awareness to Zeina of the atrocities that young innocent children suffer as victims of war. Zeina was encouraged to do something about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her charity called ‘Raising Smiles-The Iraqi Childrens&#8217; Transportation Fund’, which she began in 2005, aims to raise money to help bring wounded Iraqi children to the United States to receive medical treatment such as prosthetics, rehabilitation and surgery. Raising Smiles has been partnering up with several non-profit organisations who process the visas for the children in order to bring them to the US. Once all the transportation arrangements have been made, medical care is provided free of charge by Shriners Hospital for Children in Philadelphia. The children are also given a sum of money to cover basic living expenses upon their return back home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazed by this young woman’s story, I was intrigued to know more and decided to interview Zeina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><em><strong>(Rafeeah Laher): Please tell us a little bit about yourself and what motivated you to start Raising Smiles.</strong></em></span><br />
(Zeina Al-Khalaf): I started Raising Smiles because in the summer of my sophomore year I went to a fundraiser at George Mason University that had worked with a non-profit to bring two Iraqi children to the US who had lost their limbs during the war. The minute I laid eyes on the kids, I knew that that was something I wanted to do; I wanted to help these kids as much as I could. So the next year when I entered high school, I brought up the idea to my marketing teacher, Mr Walker, and he was the one who helped me begin Raising Smiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><em><strong>(RL): How did you spread awareness about your charity and manage to raise enough funds?</strong></em></span><br />
(ZAK): Most of the awareness came within our school, but very quickly it got picked up in the media and through the media we had a lot more supporters for Raising Smiles. It was something truly beautiful to see: a community got together to help children who they had never met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><em><strong>(RL): What were some of the major challenges that you encountered along your way?</strong></em></span><br />
(ZAK): I had some challenges from some of my classmates themselves. It was right in the middle of the war when things were getting really sensitive and some students had siblings that were serving in the war. And even though I don&#8217;t blame them for their emotions towards Iraq, we were simply helping children. Some people called me a terrorist and some just tried to give me a hard time about what I was doing, but in the end my teacher and all the other students who were helping me, got me through it all without it hurting me too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><em><strong>(RL): What has been the biggest highlight for Raising Smiles?</strong></em></span><br />
(ZAK): The biggest highlight was definitely bringing the children here from overseas. It was just the most beautiful thing you could ever see, these kids that were so loved by everyone around them. There was a special light in their eyes, a light of hope, and it&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t think anyone will ever forget. Also, what makes our organisation unique is the opportunity for us to actually meet and bond with the kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><em><strong>(RL): What’s the best thing you’ve gained from the whole experience?</strong></em></span><br />
(ZAK): I learned a lot from Raising Smiles, not only organisation-wise but also in life. I learned how to be more patient, understanding and kind. I learned that sometimes things don&#8217;t always seem fair in life and that there are a lot of things we take for granted. These kids taught me so many lessons that I can never forget and it has shaped who I am today as a woman and as a wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><em><strong>(RL): How have these kids impacted your life?</strong></em></span><br />
(ZAK): The fact that the children will return home with a part of their life back is so encouraging. I love working in fields that help people and specifically children. They are the future generations of the world, they are our hope and our future and regardless of that there&#8217;s nothing more fulfilling than bringing a smile to a child with a broken heart. There are many children around the world that need help and support and I hope that I can help change a child’s life, even if it’s just a little bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(RL): Since the founding of the organisation, there have been multiple successful fundraising events that generated enough money to help bring five Iraqi children to the United States to receive prosthetics. The children were not only able to heal from the physical wounds they had, but also somewhat the mental ones as well. Zeina has received an ABC 7 News Working Women Award in 2009 and is also a member of Generation Change, an organisation dedicated to the involvement of younger generations in national and global affairs.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Khurshid Khatib explores some of the hindrances the ummah faces when trying to work together as one body.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travelling with my father through a small British town one Friday, we stopped a passerby to ask if there was a mosque nearby so that Jumu’ah prayer could be attended. ‘Yes’, the man promptly answered, ‘Are you looking for the Bangladeshi one or the Pakistani one?’ His reply threw me. It had instantly highlighted divisions within the Muslim community (or Ummah) and a worrying disparity amongst its diverse ethnic groups enforced by this segregation. Was the mosque not supposed to be viewed as a focal point for all Muslims regardless of their cultural background? A place that brought community together to stand shoulder to shoulder in congregation with each individual having the same and common intention, that of attending a mosque simply to worship? The requirement for another mosque in the town should surely have arisen through a straightforward logistical need to accommodate an increase in number of local Muslims. But instead, it had been deemed necessary for the admission of worshippers solely according to the ethnicity of the individuals attending; these mosques were, in effect, directly creating barriers between fellow Muslims through their code of separation and going completely against the spirit of Islam and its teachings to uphold racial harmony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As mentioned in the Qur’an, Al Imran, ayah 103: <em><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">‘And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah and be not divided amongst yourselves.’</span></strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a strong association with your own culture is acknowledgement of your heritage and it is a positive sentiment to celebrate who you are and where you have come from. However, when these attachments are given an importance and emphasised to such an extent that they become a priority that is placed a long way above regarding one another with equality and respect, then there can only be an inevitable weakening, and not strengthening, of relationships between Muslims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as cultural divisions in some mosques, there appears to sometimes exist a type of judgemental behaviour and an attitude which conveys a damning message to other Muslims: that they are not deemed to be ‘religious’ enough to attend the mosque. With varying degrees of faith and knowledge, we are all travelling along life’s steep learning curve at different speeds and recognition of this fact must be acknowledged as a humbling reminder &#8211; that it is never too late to gain new information. An open discussion of differences is healthy and to have disagreements is not in itself an issue. But overcoming these differences of opinion respectfully, and without a sense of hierarchy which does not hinder progress from our ultimate goal of learning, must remain a priority. New attendees may otherwise, understandably, find themselves unwelcome and alienated by such a negative atmosphere. The following hadith reminds us of the importance of mutual respect between one another: ‘A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim. He neither oppresses him nor humiliates him nor looks down upon him’ <em>(Muslim).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This open-minded approach to building bridges also applies within a community when diverse multi-faith groups are working together. Julie Siddiqi is the Executive Director of the Islamic Society of Britain and has made many connections across the UK through networking with both Muslim and non-Muslim organisations and individuals. She is also a mentor for the UK-based charity ‘Mosaic’ and Vice Chair of her local SACRE (Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education). ‘Mosaic’, founded in 2007 by HRH Prince Charles, delivers mentoring programmes which focus on young people in some of the most deprived communities. The &#8216;About Us&#8217; section of the Mosaic Network web site explains that the programmes are “delivered by volunteers, and lift the aspirations of young people and close the gap between those aspirations and their attainment” aiming to “boost their confidence, self-efficacy and long-term employability.” Julie says “It is humbling and so important to not feel we are somehow better or more important than others because they are not part of the same faith, ethnic background or seem too ‘different’ to us. That kind of attitude can lead to wider issues and needs to be tackled and discussed very early on.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges of working successfully together as a group appear to be more easily overcome with the realisation of universal and shared experiences. Julie continues “If we focus on differences then yes, working in a diverse group will be more challenging. But we have so much in common, that can be our focus. As mothers, as wives, as sisters, as daughters, we have so much to connect with others through. Being around good, decent people, whatever faith or belief, strengthens my own faith.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason that some people are choosing to limit their exposure to different cultures is due to the fear that they will lose something of their own, without realising the benefits of enriching their existing knowledge through the learning and sharing of new experiences. Indeed, this type of direct inter-cultural community involvement is a subject area spoken about by Jamillah Karim, author of the book American Muslim Women-Negotiating race, class and gender within the Ummah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jamillah says, “The Ummah ideal seeks to create brotherhood and sisterhood among Muslims. This would entail coming to know and respect the concerns, issues, and struggles of different ethnic groups in the Ummah….Although cross-ethnic fellowship begins with understanding different perspectives, an important outcome is for people to question and change some of their beliefs and behaviours.”*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with being open to one another’s viewpoints, Jamillah also talks about the emphasis and importance that Islam places on ‘standing for justice’ whereby ‘working for change in local communities’ through shared goals is likely to bring Muslims together while coming to know one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a personal point of view, and on a more global scale, I have certainly found this last statement on working for justice especially true. Working on the Rohingya Journalism Fund, I have become connected and drawn closer to like-minded activists from a variety of religious and non-religious backgrounds where our common goals converge on a shared commitment to humanitarianism. Our different outlooks on life are irrelevant; we have found that by listening to one another, compassion and humanity are an overriding uniting force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In her booklet for the ‘Transition Network’s guide to embedding diversity and inclusion in transition’, Catrina Pickering says “When we really listen, we are able to find common ground and start from where people are at. Real listening is about being prepared to be changed by what we hear.” We are now, more than ever perhaps, better globally connected through technology and improved transport links and in many ways the world is getting smaller. But our ethnic differences are too often being allowed to cause greater separation and division within communities. A ‘Them and Us’ mentality can only serve to direct us away not only from one other but also and more fundamentally further away from the great importance that Islam gives to universal brotherhood.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Tazim Majothi shares the story of how a beautifully important coffee table book came to be.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So many of us have dreams and aspirations that we never voice, we keep them in our hearts and minds. My story is about what happens when we do have the courage to give voice to these thoughts and how Allah (SWT) puts people in our path that support our aspirations and make dreams come true. When I visited Palestine in February 2012 to plant olive trees, I could never have imagined 18 months later I would be the first person to hold the photo book ‘Roots Run Deep – Life in Occupied Palestine’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November 2010, half way through watching Budrus – a documentary-film about the uprooting of olive trees to make way for the apartheid wall – I had a very strong feeling I wanted to visit Palestine. As I left the auditorium I met with a friend from school, she remembered my name and recognised me after so many years. On enquiring what I thought of the film, I shared with Salma my wish to visit Palestine. Salma handed me a leaflet on an olive planting project in Palestine in the West Bank. She assured me it was possible as she had taken the very journey and would guide me through all preparations. I was so glad that I had voiced my thoughts because that very night I registered my interest in the programme and three months later I was planting olives trees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst in Palestine I fulfilled my childhood dream of praying in Al Aqsa mosque – something I always thought impossible. However, it didn’t fill me with the joy I had hoped as upon entering the mosque I learnt Palestinians faced restrictions and were not allowed to pray in the mosque. Knowing this saddened me and was the first example I saw of life under occupation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience was a huge learning curve. Apart from planting olive trees on Palestinian farms, we visited the historical cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem and witnessed the horrendous situation in Al Khalil (Hebron), as well as attending lectures and talks educating us on life in Palestine and its brutal occupation. I stayed with a Palestinian family which was such a special and memorable experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Towards the end of the trip we visited Bil’in for no more than half an hour. Bil’in is a village that has peacefully demonstrated against the apartheid wall and continuous expansion of settlements. That visit taught me much more about resilience, patience and determination. Bil’in was successful in claiming some of its land back and has continued to demonstrate every Friday for the last eight years.<br />
Six months after my trip, I sat in the same auditorium watching the now Oscar-nominated film ‘5 Broken Cameras’ in which I thought that I spotted photographer and activist Hamde Abu Rahma, our guide that day in Bil’in. It bugged me all evening whether it was him or not, so I messaged him via Facebook to ask. He confirmed it was and we started to keep in touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst speaking on Skype one day, Hamde shared his aspirations of wanting to make a photo book about living under the brutal Israeli apartheid. He expressed his dream of publishing a photo book illustrating the unjust and inhumane occupation. His objective was clear: to get the true message of his people out to the world. He continued to explain to me that he didn’t have a publisher, finances, designer, basic resources such as a bank or Paypal account, a postal service… the list continued. As Hamde described his dream, my mind was listing all the things that made this an impossible project.  Since we were relative strangers I didn’t share my thoughts with him but promised to buy a copy if he was successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day I messaged my brother, who had experience in publishing and design, to get Hamde a quote for his photo book &#8211; a small gesture on my part. My brother guided us to what we needed to consider in design, cost and publishing before getting a quote. I forwarded the email to Hamde who replied that he was not clear what the email meant. We Skyped to get specifications and at the end of that conversation the book started to take shape. This started the journey of two strangers, living miles away and having no experience in publishing but a shared determination to get this pictorial message out to a wider world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We raised the money for the book within three months through Facebook appeals and a small grant. During this time, Hamde was targeted and shot at on a number of occasions whilst covering news stories as a photojournalist. He was directly shot at with rubber coated steel bullets on two occasions on his shoulder and arm whilst covering demonstrations against the wall and a protest supporting prisoners on hunger strike. In addition, he was also injured in the leg by a teargas canister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hamde and I started to write the supporting text for each photo and occasionally argued over his choice of photos. Whilst we compiled the book, Bil’in continued to experience night raids, Hamde along with many activists was arrested at the newly established village of Bab Al Shams, Gaza was brutally attacked and on a nicer note Hamde became an uncle again to a niece and two nephews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting together a photo book over Skype and written e-mail messages holds many challenges and between our many exchanges much got lost in translation. Sometimes it was impossible to make decisions as for Hamde everything was seen through my eyes or the computer screen. There was unconditional trust between us, as I made many decisions on his behalf as well as managing Hamde’s finances and technical aspects of the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With guidance from my brother, we finished the book within seven months. This was a huge triumph for two people who had no experience in publishing! I was a witness to the successful unfolding of what I thought was an impossible task. We had many obstacles and challenges but continued to remain determined and committed. Month eight, it would be me that received Hamde’s books, being the first to hold the finished product. It was at that moment I remembered my long list of why this was not possible and I felt that Allah showed me that if He wills, anything is possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I write this, Hamde’s book has been posted out all over the world as he had hoped it would be. As Palestinians don’t have a postal system, Hamde is yet to see his own book. For me the project will be successful the day he gets to hold his book and I do hope it is what he envisaged in his head. Some say ‘We don’t meet people by accident. They are meant to cross our path for a reason’; I now say the same too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Since writing this article, Hamde was able to receive copies of his books through an Israeli activist .</p>
