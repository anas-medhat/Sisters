<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Open up all the windows (if you have small children make sure screens are securely in place!) and begin dusting from top to bottom. That means, grab a ladder and dust all your ceiling fans, door frames etc. Remove all the curtains and dust the rods. Let all the dust settle and move to the mid- height items like your tables and chairs. Dust those well and then grab your vacuum (emptied first for maximum suction) to suck up all the dust.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>2. NOW THAT YOUR HOME IS CLEAN, START ADDING A FEW NEW THINGS </strong></span></p>
<p>Buy new drapes and bedspreads in complimentary colours. If the paint on your walls is light, try choosing darker coloured fabrics. If your walls are dark, go for lighter coloured fabrics. Be sure to choose designs that you feel best reflect the sunny spring mood that you&#8217;re in.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Nadia Masood talks about her latest fascination for clay pots and rekindling their use in a modern kitchen.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Are you serious?” my husband looked at me, amazed, as if I had asked for the most unusual thing in the world. I had just asked the waiter, at a fine dining restaurant, if I could take home the empty clay pot that contained the biryaani we had relished minutes ago. My husband had flatly refused to ask the waiter himself, suggesting that he’d buy one for me from the market instead. However, I wanted this biryaani pot because, apart from it being a reminder of the wonderful dinner we had just had, it would also be a good way to recycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My interest in clay pots began this summer while vacationing in India. It all started with some cold lassi &#8211; a traditional milk and yoghurt drink &#8211; served in clay tumblers. While most people would usually just discard the clay container afterwards, I brought it home with me to reuse, and have since been collecting earthenware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tradition of pottery in the Asian subcontinent is as old as human civilisation itself and is considered a sensual art form, identified with the feminine qualities of grace and delicacy. During early times, each village had its own potter, who held a respectable place in society because they made a myriad of articles used in the regular household. An example is the clay-made piggy bank that children used to have. This only had a one-way slot for coin insertion so that when the piggy bank was full, the custom was to smash it on the ground and retrieve the collected money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main use of clay pottery, however, was for making cooking vessels. These clay pots worked best for dishes that require cooking on a low heat for hours, like mutton curry, goats’ trotters, black lentil curry, etc. Hyderabad, India, is famous for its ‘dum ki biryaani’ that is slow cooked in a huge clay pot. In some parts of India and Bangladesh, there is a special, heavily-spiced fish curry that is cooked only in earthen cauldrons. In Pakistan, women prepare and store pickles in clay jars. Sweets like kheer &#8211; rice pudding &#8211; is also set, chilled and served in clay bowls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooking in clay pots is a great way to add flavour and reduce fat in our diet. Unlike vessels of other materials, food cooked in clay pots is less likely to stick &#8211; thus reducing the need for more oils. The pot is always soaked in water for at least fifteen minutes before use so that it is saturated with water and because clay is a porous material, steam evaporates slowly when it is heated in the oven. During cooking, the food inside the clay pot releases liquid and cooks in its own juices. These juices remain sealed inside the pot until it is completely dry &#8211; which is around the time the food has cooked completely &#8211; hence adding to the flavour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the arrival of modern cooking vessels like non-stick pots, casseroles and pressure cookers, clay pots slowly disappeared from households. Besides, with the fast pace of today’s lifestyle, the slow cooking process in clay pots became quite an inconvenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it’s nice to see that efforts are being made to rediscover and revive the use of clay pots today, especially in high-end restaurants where food is served in earthenware. There are several advantages to bringing the ancient cooking vessel back: healthy food, being environmentally-friendly, a touch of tradition, jobs for potters and aesthetics (yes, food served in a clay pot is very appealing). In fact, it has gained so much popularity that some restaurants are giving decorative token clay pots for desserts! Finding food served in clay pots in India or Pakistan is common, but I am pleasantly surprised to find them here in the U.A.E – like biryaani, desserts and even tea!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I make an effort to use clay pots regularly because of the health benefits, added flavours and for being eco-friendly. Of course, another important factor is that I take a lot of food pictures for my blog and I know that serving them in traditional clay pots will make the presentation even better. Now, whenever we dine in a restaurant that serves in clay pots, I try to ask the staff if I can take the pot home, and they almost always agree. As a result, I am now the proud owner of six clay cups for tea, two clay bowls for sweets and one gorgeous handi or round-bellied clay pot in my collection &#8211; all of them complimentary tokens from restaurants! As much as I love cooking and serving food in them, family members and guests are equally delighted to experience eating out of a clay pot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Nadia Ali proves that gardens can flourish in even the smallest of spaces.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is something alluring about beautiful fresh green herbs or fragrant flowers bursting with colour. Even the taste of juicy cherry tomatoes that are ready to pick from your very own kitchen window-box is exquisite. SubhanAllah! It doesn’t have to be something you just read about; you too can experience the joys of growing your own compact garden with amazing results! You don’t need acres of garden to achieve this &#8211; all you need is a window-box that can be placed in your house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Choosing a Window-box</strong></span><br />
I talked to my friend Azmine who lives in a second floor flat in London where she has access to a communal garden, but is limited to what she can actually plant there. She says her kitchen windowsill allows her to have blooming plants and herbs close at hand at any time of the year, adding, “I like the small trough window-box which fits right on my windowsill.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The varieties of window-boxes that are available are quite surprising. The plain plastic ones are the least expensive, with the price increasing in line with the durability and decorative element. The beautiful wooden or zinc window boxes are among the most expensive. When choosing one, make sure the box has drainage holes, a depth of at least 20 cm, and a drip tray, otherwise you’ll have a constant mess on your hands. Bear in mind that the bigger the box, the more room your plants have to grow. A good tip is to buy a terracotta window-box and have interchangeable plastic ones inside so you can swap them out. The compost also remains fresher this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prepare the box for planting, simply line with cardboard so the roots are protected and don’t grow out through the drainage holes. Now, decide where you are going to put the box. Is the area shady or sunny? Is there a strong wind because your window is higher up? Determining the answers to this question will steer you in the right direction to the type of plants you grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Plants</strong></span><br />
There is a huge variety of plants that can be grown from the comfort of your home. You can pick your favourite herb, and choose between the varieties of flowering perennials to provide a year-round display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Herbs</strong></span><br />
The Qur’an mentions herbs twice and says, <em><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;bring forth for us of what the earth grows.”</strong> </span>(Al-Baqarah:61)</em></p>
<p>Specific aromatic and healthy herbs include garlic, thyme, chives, basil, rosemary, parsley and sage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Flowers</strong></span><br />
Petunias, marigolds, impatiens, violets, lavender, geraniums, sweet William, pansies, daffodils, tulips, and heather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Vegetables</strong></span><br />
Cherry tomatoes, sweet bell peppers, lettuce, garlic, and radishes can all be grown in a window-box garden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azmine says, “I generally plant whatever is left over from a salad.” This way, you eliminate the expense of going out to find seeds or seedlings. “Every day I look at them and water them and see how many leaves they have.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can share your new found interest with your children, from the very beginning of planting a seed to the first shoot, to the growth and blossoming of plants. You can even get creative and make a well balanced floral design. Choose tall plants for the backdrop, ornamental plants for the foreground and cascading greenery for a highly personalised window-box with a winning style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, go on! Start your own window-box garden and experience the joy of growing your own herbs and plants. When did you last watch a cooking show on TV and hear the chef say, “Here are some herbs from my garden”? Now you can say the same!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Lail Hossain provides tips on how to successfully turn your windows into showstoppers.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Window treatments are one of the easiest ways to make a visual impact in a room, as our eyes are naturally drawn to the light from windows already. Gone are the days of heavy window coverings. Simple fabric panels that still allow light in are one of the easiest and most popular window-treatment options and add a decorative touch to a room. Having a hard time finding the perfect drapes or panels at the right price? Bed sheets, tablecloths, drop cloths and burlap are neutral and cheap and they come in a variety of dimensions to fit different window sizes. Read on for 8 easy ways to add stylish touches to your windows!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Curtains are exceptionally decorative and enhance a room’s architecture while making a stylish statement. For a casual and informal space, such as the kitchen, try using shorter curtains. Long curtains add height and bring drama to a room. The longer the curtains, the more dramatic and elegant the room’s design becomes. Use longer drapes in living rooms and bedrooms to add style and sophistication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Organic materials bring nature indoors. Bamboo matchstick blinds and natural woven shades create an elegant yet earthy sophistication when layered with simple, sheer linen panels.  To always stay in style, use window treatments that allow a lot of natural light into the space. Brighten up the room with cheerful draperies and layers of sheer panels that add warmth to the room but let light through at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Draperies in jewel tones ranging from ruby reds to amethyst and turquoise, mixed with soft metallic sheer panels such as gold, platinum and brushed nickel, have made a grand appearance in the world of window treatments. The jewel and metallic tones blend beautifully. Geometric patterns are another trend that is sure to stay for a long time. Wide stripes in contrasting hues provide a more modern look to a room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Personalising your curtains can add style and drama to otherwise boring panels made of bed sheets, drop cloth or burlap, even with minimal sewing skills. Add grommets for an expensive look or use decorative rings.  Feel free to give a coat of metallic spray paint to the rings for extra glamour.  Turn inexpensive fabric into gorgeous panels by adding trim to the bottom or sides.  Decorative embellishments such as ribbons, beads, shells, lace and buttons are easy ways to upgrade even regular store-bought panels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
5. Using fabric paint, add geometric shapes, bold stripes or a floral pattern, freehand or with the help of a stencil.  Random patterns on the panels will give a traditional look while streamlined patterns in a line will provide a more modern look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Branches make for excellent, sculptural drapery rods with a few simple updates. Select a branch with the proper length and width to fit above a window and that can handle the weight of the chosen drapery panel. Then, cut it to size and spray paint. Make sure the colour you choose contrasts well with the wall.  Secure the branch with screws, drapery rod brackets or L-brackets.  Golf clubs and hockey sticks are also good options for drapery rods.   A strong nautical rope or a braided one is an excellent alternative to store-bought drapery rods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Curtains can be pulled back with ties, pinned apart or simply allowed to hang freely.  Decorative tiebacks from the store are great, but you can also create your own. Add a little extra personalisation with something that speaks to you – shells from a beach vacation, a family heirloom, a vintage doorknob or something that is just sitting around the home.  Ribbons, bandanas, lace handkerchiefs or three pieces of rope braided together make sturdy tiebacks. Use one or more tones or colours, but be sure to secure the ends with hot glue. Neckties too can be repurposed as stylish curtain tiebacks. Use bracelets and cuffs by placing them around drapery panels. Let the panels hang freely or create a more permanent look by attaching the bracelets to the wall with Velcro.  An old leather belt can also be turned into a stylish and preppy tieback. Wrap the belt around the gathered drapery panel and secure the belt to the wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. A great option for those tiny rooms that feel too small for curtains is window film. There are hundreds of designs available to choose from that are not hard on the wallet. A top treatment such as a valance can make a room open and inviting also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you are trying to add more privacy, shade or insulation or to enhance the elegance of a room by adding a pop of colour, there is a fresh window treatment option out there for you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winter is a time when one turns on the central heating, gets out the duvet and wears comfy socks around the house. The days are shorter, the nights are longer and there’s nothing better than coming home at the end of a hard day and feeling cosy and warm inside your house. Here are five simple ways to enhance the warmth and take the bitterness out of the cold wind. Embrace winter &#8211; for if Allah had not alternated the weather, we would not appreciate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There is no deity except Allah. How cold is this day! O Allah (SWT), protect me from the bitter cold section of Jahannum” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Hadith by Ibn As-Sunni)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Blankets</strong></span><br />
Blankets are synonymous with winter. They come in two categories of fabric &#8211; natural and synthetic. Natural fibre blankets are made of cotton, wool, linen and down (bird feathers). Synthetic blankets are hypoallergenic, softer and less expensive, with many different brands, styles and designs to suit your home décor and personal style. That said, the number one choice in bedding to keep warm is a duvet. Nowadays, almost everyone sleeps under a duvet in winter as it provides abundant warmth and comfort. You can also interchange the covers to suit your style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Electric blankets are also a good source of warmth and can be used on top of your bedding or over you when you are relaxing on a sofa. However, their use is on the decline due to efficient central heating and double glazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Scents and Incense</strong></span><br />
Have you ever walked into someone’s house to an aroma that beckons you to come in and have a seat? With a simple scented candle you too can achieve this result. Candles also create a warm glow, adding ambiance, setting and atmosphere to a room. Prophet Muhammad (SAW) loved fragrances and never refused an offer to put some on or burn incense in his dwelling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Prophet (SAW) would not refuse perfume.”  <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Bukhari and Tirmidhi)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many variations of scents, from the aromas of the East, such as sandalwood or musk, to Western fragrances, such as seasonal roasted chestnut and vanilla.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Heavy Curtains</strong></span><br />
There’s something warm and inviting about winter curtains. Choose deep, rich colours in a thicker fabric that will work double-duty to block out the draughts. Ensure they are full length with a lining for maximum insulation and that the material overlaps to seal the warmth in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Lighting</strong></span><br />
Adding extra lighting during winter is the easiest way to introduce warmth into your home. You can use candles, floor, table or wall lamps and even lanterns. Floor lamps provide a central light source, without having to use the harsh overhead ceiling light, and come in numerous styles from traditional to Tiffany style. Table lamps offer soft lighting in dark winter corners where there is no natural light. Nowadays there are even multifunctional LED adhaan lamps which add a modern touch and remind you when to pray!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Colours</strong></span><br />
Colour can influence your mood, behaviour and even appetite. It is a powerful tool when it comes to interior home decoration. Imagine you come in from the cold to a grey room with brown furniture and accessories – somehow, it still feels cold. Now, imagine coming in from the cold into a room full of deep red, emerald green, orange and yellow – it definitely feels brighter than outside. Use colour to create warmth inside of your house through cushions, tablecloths, curtains, towels, sheeting and other accessories. A sprinkling of eye-catching colour will turn the drab grey of winter into the warm ambiance of winter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when the chill of winter begins, fragrance the inside of your house with a scented aroma that beckons you inside to a warm glow of colours, enhanced by well placed lamps. Simply pull the curtains shut and enjoy a perfect, cosy winter’s evening indoors.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Najma Mohamed offers an array of earth-friendly tips for heating our homes and lightening our carbon footprints.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winter temperatures, particularly in the northern hemisphere, have been plummeting in the last fifteen years. If your heating bills have not raised the alert yet, perhaps you need to start factoring in just how much heating costs impact on your carbon footprint. Whether you take weather predictions to heart or not, finding ways to reduce home heating costs through alternative means, is both good for the planet and your wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your carbon footprint is a measure of all the greenhouse gases you produce in your day-to-day life through burning fossil fuels for electricity, heating and transportation for example. Escalating electricity bills and concerns about the contribution of home heating to domestic carbon footprints, especially in colder regions, have led to the search for new (and old) ways to heat our homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A home energy audit, conducted by certified technicians, which looks at energy use in the home and identifies areas of energy ‘loss’ and waste, can go a long way in improving energy efficiency in your home. You can also conduct your own energy audit and many online resources, such as the UK Carbon Calculator, can guide you in the right direction. Before installing heating technologies, you have to find ways to insulate your home from the winter chill. New insulation technologies, as well as tried-and-tested insulation materials like wood, wool, and straw are making a comeback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deciding upon a particular insulation and/or heating technology for your home can initially appear costly, but bear in mind that initial outlay costs will be recovered through reductions in electricity bills. If you are at the stage of building or renovating your home, this is the best time to not only select and install green insulation and heating technologies, but also to adopt green design principles which can collect and hold sunlight – more on this later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The starting point in weathering your home for the winter is to look for all the areas in your home where cold gets in &#8211; before the onset of the cold season. Begin by insulating your home and, wherever possible, try to do it yourself. Insulate your home by sealing windows and doors, adding weather stripping or even a doorsweep. Always make sure windows are airtight and can close properly, replace locks if necessary. Before you even start thinking about spending on heating technologies, consider all the insulation options available. Today, insulation technologies are fire-resistant, can be installed in ceilings and walls, and are often sourced from recycled plastic, glass and newspapers. Insulation can reduce energy requirements in winter tremendously so it is worth considering before opting for heating technologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, look at what energy source you are using for heating your home. Some governments require that a percentage of home energy usage be from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy. If you are fortunate to have this option, try to buy as much of your energy needs from renewable sources. Don’t be discouraged by the high outlay costs of alternative heating technologies, they can come with government subsidisation, which will reduce your electricity bill by as much as 40-60%, and most importantly will reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Several alternative home heating options are available and you will have to get advice on the option which is suitable for your budget, location and needs. The efficacy of solar heating for instance depends on where you are living, in sunny South Africa or chilly Canada. Solar heat technology still relies on some electricity to move the heat collected by solar collectors. This technology collects heat from the sun and stores, transfers and distributes energy to the home. This is referred to as active solar energy, but there are also passive ways in which we can harness the sun’s warmth. Sun intake can be maximised through the design and orientation of windows, by using floor and wall materials which absorb heat, and through building designs which collect and hold sunlight such as skylights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two other heating technologies which will be considered here are radiant and geothermal heating. In radiant heating technologies, heat is supplied directly to the floor or to panels in the wall or ceiling. In hydronic radiant floor heating, the most popular and earth-friendly radiant heating technology, water is heated from a boiler and then pumped through a tubing pattern which has been laid underneath the floor. Floor coverings with a high heat capacity, such as ceramic tiles, conduct, store and radiate the heat through the floor. Geothermal or ground source heat pumps also rely on a network of underground tubes which are filled with fluid, but instead tap into the warmth of the earth underneath to retrieve the heat needed to warm the underground tubing. Expert help needs to be solicited in assessing which heating technology is most suitable, earth-friendly and cost effective for you. While heating technologies do have high installation costs, they are low maintenance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In designing or renovating your home, there are several factors which can make a big impact on insulating and heating your home. Position your home to achieve maximum heat absorption from the sun. Locate windows, as well as rooms and doors, to harness the sun’s energy. Incorporate building designs and technologies which collect and hold sunlight such as double-paned glass windows which reduce heat loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re starting to worry about the cost of all these home heating technologies, here are some which won’t dent your wallet too much:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Warm your home with drapes or heavy curtains, selecting fabrics and colours which will absorb the heat of the winter sun and add warmth to your home<br />
• Lay rugs and carpets<br />
• Install and refurbish old fireplaces<br />
• Use a wood-fired stove, many of which use recycled wood chips and pellets for heating<br />
• Be active, dress warmly &amp; sip warm beverages, keeping in mind to boil just the amount of water you need for your cuppa</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Have a warm winter!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Lail Hossain shows us how to take charge of disorganised bathrooms.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we seek purity of the soul, our physical body and home cannot be ignored; they are all interconnected.  Cleanliness of the soul, body and home is a great virtue in Islam. A cluttered house ignites stress and tiredness and disrupts thoughts. Have you ever noticed how distracted and anxious emotions go through us when worshipping in a cluttered area? On the other hand, a serene, shipshape environment uplifts one spiritually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s turn a hectic home into the ultimate soothing space with a few simple tips and tricks, starting with the busiest yet smallest room in most homes &#8211; the bathroom. You owe it to yourself to attain a sense of harmony, peace, and tranquility as you prepare for prayers, so make your wudhu in a calm, clean and uncluttered bathroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one likes to see kids’ bath toys scattered all over the floor or fight through the toys to take a shower &#8211; or worse yet, trip over them. Do you really have the time to find your favourite eyeliner, brushes, and bottles when they are all jumbled together?  There is only so much counter or cabinet space we can have to cram everything in, no matter how big the bathroom is.  The solution, you ask?  Cut the clutter and get creative in finding storage solutions within the space you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8a41;"><strong>Reduce the Clutter</strong></span><br />
Reassess, donate, and discard.  Keep clutter under control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re-evaluate your true needs.  How many types of hair and body cleansing products do you and your family really need?  And that makeup stash of yours?  Is it that hard to part with those eleven shades of pink nail polish and fifteen maroon lipsticks?  Keep only what you are really going to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donate any unopened or lightly used products that you are unlikely to use to shelters or to a toiletry drive near you.  Ramadhan teaches us about how little we can get by with.  During Ramadhan, we eat less, drink less, talk less, argue less and sleep less.  It’s amazing how little we need.  Pack up all the extras and give them away.  Give away your ten extra nail polishes, purses and hundred pairs of shoes that you have not used in the last six months.  Those knick-knacks you picked up from the hotel on your last trip and those lotion and perfume samples you collect are taking up valuable real estate.  Use them up or donate them.  Many shelters not only take unopened hair and skincare products, but also lightly used makeup, to give to women who are trying to get on their feet and preparing for a job interview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toss out any old, expired or broken items.  As for makeup, the general replacement guideline for mascara and liquid eyeliner is about six months; foundation, lip liner and nail polish a year; and lipsticks, eye shadow, concealer and blush eighteen months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8a41;"><strong>Find Storage Solutions</strong></span><br />
No matter how big or small your bathroom is, without identifying adequate and appropriate storage solutions, clutter will find its way in and become a constant problem.  Containers, boxes or baskets keep the odds and ends out of sight, immediately giving a sense of sleekness to the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stackable boxes of varying sizes create supplementary space under the sink or inside shelves.  Depending on your budget, buy fabric or plastic drawers or reuse cardboard boxes (make pretty by painting or wrapping with wrapping paper in a uniform color).  Put things used in the same way or at the same time such as skincare, hair products or first aid items in the same box for easy finding.  Keep all eyeshadows and lip liners together, and lipsticks upright so it’ll be easy to find what you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Making the most out of available options using vertical space and unused areas for creative organisation is the best approach to take:</em><br />
• Floating shelves or cubes above the toilet are great ways to take advantage of the unused vertical space.<br />
• Buy a tiered plate or glue cheap pretty plates on candleholders to create tiered storage.  Add one or two small cups to the top level for storing smaller items, such as cotton swabs, bobby pins, safety pins, makeup brushes, etc.<br />
• Use hanging tiered fruit baskets to hold toys or use as a shower caddy in the bathroom.<br />
• Make use of corners by using corner shelves to boost space in a  small bathroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Make use of the doors for easy storage:</em><br />
• Install one or more towel bars on the door.<br />
• Repurpose tin cans or mason jars inside cabinet doors to hold your hair brush, hair dryer and straightener, and tame the unruly cords.<br />
• Attach a magazine rack behind cabinet doors and you instantly have a pocket for stowing toiletries.<br />
• Attach a sheet of pre-cut galvanised steel to a door’s interiors and add magnetic hooks to hold scissors and tweezers. Add small plastic cups with magnetic bottoms or metal tins to hold small items, such as rubber bands and hair clips.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Find storage solutions in unexpected items:</em><br />
• Use small flowerpots or repurpose mason jars to store q-tips, cotton balls and makeup applicators.<br />
• Kitchen utensil holders are great to hold toothpaste, toothbrushes and makeup brushes.<br />
• If you have a window in your bathroom, attach a flower box to store towels and other toiletries.<br />
• Store bobby pins on a magnetic strip in a drawer.<br />
• Install a tension rod to hold cleaning supply spray bottles inside cabinets.<br />
• If you’ve always admired that wine rack at the store but never knew how to use it in your home, use it as a towel holder. Fold the towels and show them off neatly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organisation is an on-going process and not a one-time task. Many of these concepts can be carried out in other areas of your home as well. Get in the habit of controlling clutter by giving away or putting away that which you do not use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The best place to find a helping hand is at the end of your own arm, as Sumayyah Meehan explains. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the ever-growing pressures of work and the responsibilities of worship, there is not always a man around the house when you need him! So when something breaks, cracks, clogs or spontaneously combusts, Muslimahs these days are looking to themselves to make minor home or appliance repairs. Economically speaking, Muslimahs really need to know the basics of home repair, like how to wield a hammer or repair a leaky faucet, otherwise any extra cash on hand will go straight into the repair man’s pocket! It might be intimidating to imagine yourself ripping up floorboards or painting an entire room by yourself, but empowering yourself with the bare minimum of home repair know-how will help relieve stress when things break. And most importantly you won’t have to nag, beg or complain to someone else to fix them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This month SISTERS speaks to 3 Muslimah Ms. Fix-It’s who share their home repair advice and past projects. If they can do it, so can YOU!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>In charge  </strong></span><br />
“I am a Mrs Fix-it, because my husband works like crazy, worships and teaches children how to read and understand the Qur’an, so I have no choice but to fix things myself,” shares Khadija Ghamougui, a housewife from Pennsylvania, USA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Izdehar Albowyha, a housewife residing in California, USA, shares a similar story. “My husband is not someone who knows how to do any fixing jobs so they end up in my lap. When I fix something, I give it a lot of thought. I analyse what I need to do and picture it in my head.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some Muslimahs home-repairs are second-nature and something they love doing. “I love making things with my hands,” shares Ann Kamran, an office manager living in London, who loves to create and see a finished product.  “If something needs to be done and it’s not getting done, I’ll do it. My dear husband spoils me and won’t let me do anything laborious around the house, but I will do it on my own if I know my husband is busy.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Finding the Necessary Skills </strong></span><br />
Having the initiative to make home repairs and possessing the necessary skills to do so successfully are two entirely separate things. Simply picking up a hammer or a drill and figuring it out along the way will not work and might end up in an even worse home repair nightmare or even injury. Before engaging in any home repair project, you should research the project on the internet or home repair books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I love to watch home improvement shows and take tips,” says Sister Izdehar. “I also go to Home Depot and ask the salesperson a hundred questions until I have the necessary knowledge. I might even ask my brother or a family member for home repair advice.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Sister Khadijah was blessed to have a teacher who taught her the basics of home repair when she was a child.  “I watched and worked with my father when I was younger. And I also had to figure some things out on my own when I was a single mom raising three children,” she says. Sister Ann says that she was always inclined towards home repair: “I had my own toolbox and power drill before I met my husband.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Sweet Success!</strong> </span><br />
Sister Ann’s greatest victory in home repair is a room that she painted in her sister’s home. “I painted the room pastel green on the bottom half and soft blue rolling hills on the upper half,” she shares, “and around the top of the entire room is a painted vine with leaves and the alphabet ‘growing’ from the vine. I also added little hearts and stars stenciled on the tops of the rolling hills with inspirational words painted in the valleys.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Sister Khadijah’s greatest home repair success story was when she hit the roof, literally! “The biggest thing that I fixed would be the roof. I had to rip everything off and start all over. I covered the entire roof with new wood and then shingling. It was so much fun, but I had to be careful not to slip!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As for Sister Izdehar she turned her kitchen floor into a grand masterpiece when she decided to redo the entire floor herself. “First I ripped up the old floor and put in a new sub floor. Then I went to a home repair shop to buy tiles and seek advice. It came out beautifully, Alhamdullilah!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Aisha Abbasi shows ways to build the perfect study or creative space in your home.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My inspiration for this space comes from childhood memories of my father’s amazing cushy corner. It was furnished with large cushions, lush ruby fabrics, tall dark bookshelves filled with hardback books, a velvet-covered table where his speeches were prepared and a globe lamp of the world resting atop. The room was out-of-bounds when we were young or unsupervised. As we entered our teens, our visits to the room became more fruitful and we would read for hours, sunk into those cushions. With intricately detailed Persian rugs spread on the floor and covering the walls, and foreign Arabian ouds sprinkled in the room, it felt like we had drifted into faraway Eastern lands with all their mystical charms every time we entered it for study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us can create our own inspirational study space within our homes. The idea is to take a study area or a spare or cluttered corner of the room, de-clutter it and re-organise using various household fabrics and furniture to build the perfect creative corner for yourself or the entire family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>1. Intentions</strong></span><br />
Build your corner for Allah (SWT). You could read to attain knowledge, teach your siblings or children something new, or even hold circles with friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>2. Size and space</strong></span><br />
Dependent on how you use your corner, size will matter. You may create your cushy corner on the floor, therefore ensure there is enough space to curl up or stretch your legs. For desks, ensure you have enough leg room. For work tables, you might decide that you will need enough space to walk around the table or even push your desk against one wall. Consider a window an opportunity to make your space brighter and keep you wide awake. Ensure you are not blocking any heating or vents in the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>3. Colour it</strong></span><br />
You will want to think about blending your special corner with the room it is in and yet ensuring it has its own personality. If your room is a neutral colour, your corner may contain splashes of one bold colour. Try earthy colours and greens for a forest look, reds and maroons for a Persian/Arab look, creams and neutrals with splashes of colour for a more conventional look or even various blues to create an aquatic feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>4. Embellish it</strong></span><br />
For desks and work tables, consider covering the table with fabric or even laminate plastic. If you are one who enjoys working on the floor then floor-cushions or even a chaise lounge will work well. You could even drape your own select fabrics over a deck chair. Spread a soft rug or even make your own patchwork rug out of leftover fabrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>5. Bookshelf it</strong></span><br />
Add your existing bookcase to this corner or add a shelf for easy access to books you read daily. There are a number of space-saving methods worth looking into such as horizontal and vertical shelving or overhead shelving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>6. Create a poster board</strong></span><br />
Put together a poster board using a large flattened-out cardboard box. Cut to the size you want, back it with wrapping paper or embellished cloth and stick on quotes, notes and pictures to inspire you. Avoid sticking your posters and notes all over the walls to refine the area and keep it less cluttered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>7. Scents</strong></span><br />
Soothing calming scents of vanilla and lavender can be placed in little tea light pots on shelves or use potpourri sachets. Fresh lavender picked from the garden is even better. Incense sticks and air fresheners can also help set the mood for building the perfect atmosphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>8. Lighting</strong></span><br />
Do you like to work under bright light or low light? Keep a balance between the two to prevent eyestrain, especially if you know you may snuggle up in your corner into the late hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May your cushy corner help you think up wonderful ideas, carry out good deeds and implement beautiful actions for Allah’s (SWT) sake. Ameen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up as a non-Muslim, I have fond memories of celebrating Christmas, even though my family were not religious. We would prepare for the day long before, setting up a Christmas tree and decorating the house with garlands and shiny baubles. For my first Eid as a new Muslim, I had a great sense of excitement as the day approached, as well as a melancholic feeling at the thought of the blessed month of Ramadhan finishing and the resumption of normal life. But the day itself was an anti-climax in the sense that I wasn’t able to recreate the magical feeling of my childhood. Firstly because I wasn’t with family, but also because I didn’t prepare for it in the same way as I used to do for Christmas. Yes, I did bake some biscuits, and I loved the early morning prayers in the mosque, the chants of “Allahu Akbar” and the sight of children in their best attire, but I didn’t know what to do with myself the rest of the day. Now, with a toddler daughter who will probably remember this year’s Ramadhan and Eid as her first ones, I am determined to make it a magical period for her, and to create family traditions that we can reproduce every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To welcome the last iftar of Ramadhan and the start of the holiday, I like the idea of creating a peaceful, spiritual atmosphere with candles and flowers. It is very easy to create patterned candle-holders with glass jars and paint, and it can make a nice activity to do with the children during the long days of fasting, especially as Ramadhan falls in the summer holidays in the UK this year. I love Moroccan lanterns, and I have found that tea glasses work great with tea candles. I also make an effort with table decorations: even a patterned napkin and a nice set of plates can create a special atmosphere fit for the Arabian nights!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, the morning of Eid should be child-orientated: unlike Eid-ul-Adha, when the first day of celebrations is often devoted to the sacrifice of the sheep and the preparation of the meat, Eid-ul-Fitr is all about rejoicing and relaxing after a month of fasting and restrictions. There are many ways to make your house ready for such a joyous occasion: garlands, balloons, bunting and other baubles. You can make an “Eid Mubarak” bunting with triangles cut out from fabric or crepe paper &#8211; that’s another afternoon of activities for the kids sorted! I found a large selection of ideas for making your own decorations online, using cheap materials and staying in line with Muslim culture, rather than using Christmas baubles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same goes for food: there are lots of accessories and inspirational ideas available online to make your own special Eid cakes and biscuits: star-shaped cookies, fondant decorations representing mosques, calligraphy written with an icing pen… And of course, an abundance of halal sweets! I’m a real sucker for healthy food, but Eid is the one occasion when I will allow my children (and myself) to enjoy a sugary treat. Allah has forbidden us to fast on the days of Eid; and since Ramadhan is all about fasting and not midnight feasts (yes, I’m looking at you, demanding husbands), Eid is the day to create a sumptuous meal to be remembered. Of course, I don’t suggest you spend the day in the kitchen &#8211; many treats can be bought, or prepared in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eid is very much about sharing food and joy with your close ones and the wider Muslim community, and for this reason I adore Eid cards. Not being able to spend Eid with my family, I have at least the pleasure of selecting a beautiful card to send them, with pictures of our celebration. There is such a wide selection available online and in Islamic shops nowadays that it would be a shame not to use them: calligraphy, crescent moons, pictures of mosques… You can also make your own! To exchange gifts, I find that a detail such as using gift paper rather than presenting it in a bag is a thoughtful touch, and there is nothing more enjoyable than the sight of children shredding the paper to find out what is inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to assure you that creating a wonderful, special celebration doesn’t need to come at a high price. You will find that you cherish the decorations you and your children have made with your own hands more than standard ones, and you can keep them for the years to come. A beautiful house is not about expensive furniture and fancy decorations, but rather about creating a welcoming atmosphere and adding personal touches that make you feel at home.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Saudah Saleem is back with fun, elegant ideas to add sophistication and style to your ‘Eid festivities. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, instead of using the predictable streamers and balloons to decorate your home for ‘Eid, why not get creative and try a fresh, contemporary approach to traditional ‘Eid festivities and decor? Whether you&#8217;re hosting a casual or formal affair, the table, theme and decor can instantly transform the space and set the mood for your guests. Setting a beautiful table and entertaining guests for your ‘Eid celebration is easier than you may think. Here are some stylish, non-traditional alternatives for creating the perfect setting this ‘Eid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Classic elegance</strong></span><br />
Create a dramatic and elegant effect using shimmering metallic hues.  Purchase enough chipboard letters from your local craft store to spell out “‘Eid Mubarak.” Give the letters a glamorous makeover by spray painting them with metallic spray paint. Place the letters along the length of the table. Surround the letters with tea lights in varying sized metallic holders. Add another layer of sophistication by putting place cards or simple menu cards made with metallic cardstock at each place setting for your guests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Go green</strong></span><br />
Instead of all the fussy decor, create a more organic, down–to-earth feel by using elements from nature to emphasise the beauty of simplicity. Shop in your own backyard or local park for pinecones, berries, twigs, or greenery to serve as decorative table accents. Cover your tables with fresh white linen tablecloths. Then use a piece of burlap fabric (now available in several different hues) cut to the length of the table, as a table runner. To continue the appreciation for nature vibe, look for ayat in the Qur’an that relate to Allah’s creation and nature, print them on decorative cardstock and put them in simple frames. Place the frames near and around the buffet for guests to read and reflect upon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Give your ‘Eid celebration a theme</strong></span><br />
Make the festivities more interactive by creating a theme. For example, try hosting an “Around the World in 80 days” ‘Eid Celebration. Select 5 or more countries that will interest your guests. Grab an international cookbook or find recipes online, and prepare dishes and desserts that represent the countries you’ve selected. The food should be served buffet style to allow guests to sample dishes at their leisure. Place index cards in front of each food station or tray with the dish’s name and key ingredients, the country’s local customs and how ‘Eid is celebrated in that country. Finally, use colourful cardstock and scrapbook paper to create faux passports for guests. Hand out passports to each guest as they arrive. Be sure to place a stamp or stickers at each station that guests can use to update their “passports” as they “travel” along the culinary journey from country to country. Your guests will enjoy learning how ‘Eid is celebrated in various countries as well as dining on exotic cuisine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Add a designer touch with a lavish dessert table</strong></span><br />
Decide on a theme or colour scheme; use fabric that coordinates with your chosen theme or colour to create a backdrop and tablecloth for your dessert display. Place a nicely decorated cake on a cake stand or use a tower of cupcakes to serve as your centerpiece. Surround the centerpiece with a combination of clear containers, trays and dishes of your favorite sweets and desserts. Then use cardstock to make hand written labels to place in front of each dish. Sprinkle the table with confetti, rose petals or glitter to continue the festive feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Give them a proper send off</strong></span><br />
Continue the ‘Eid spirit when your guests leave. Providing a treat for guests to take home is a thoughtful touch and can be put together in advance of the party. Whether wrapped in simple craft paper with vintage ribbon or packaged in shiny gift bags, party favours are the perfect opportunity to keep guests thinking about the celebration even after the party is over. Items like henna, dates, pocket sized Qur’ans or du’a books make ideal gifts for this occasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Take the party outside</strong></span><br />
With Ramadhan ending in the summer months this year, why not turn your ‘Eid celebration into a Backyard Soirée? Clean your yard and use candles, lanterns and outdoor string lights to create a festive night under the stars for guests. Plan outdoor games and use skewers to serve grilled vegetables and fruit.</p>

<p>Who wouldn&#8217;t want to have a beautiful, spacious home? Flowers carefully arranged in vases, matching cushions and curtains, stylish bed linen and comfortable pillows. Everything in its place. Indeed, we sisters take pride in our homes, and rightly so, as Allah has designated that all important space to us to look after and care for. However, have we ever asked ourselves whether or not our homes are ones in which the Prophet (SAW) would feel comfortable? Whether the angels enter with ease? Whether Allah (SWT) is pleased with it? How can we make our homes into Islamic havens of tranquility and comfort?</p>

<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Remember and worship Allah many times a day</strong></span><br />
Remembrance of Allah can be in many forms: with the heart, through prayer, recitation of Qur&#8217;an, memorising duas and using them, discussing Islamic issues, or reading Islamic material. Establish the salah within the home at its required time and have members of the family pray in congregation when several are present. The family may also designate a specific area for prayer and maintain its uniqueness and cleanliness.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Make learning about Islam a habitual family activity</strong></span><br />
Attaining knowledge is incumbent upon every Muslim and it is the basis upon which iman (faith) will flourish. Try designating two evenings a week to listen to an Islamic lecture, for example. You could also establish a study circle in the home. Encourage your children to participate since this will establish a pattern for them that will be carried throughout their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Have an Islamic library</strong></span></p>
<p>This may include such things as books, cassette tapes, and CDs. It is important to choose accurate and reliable material. Have books that cover a variety of topics and keep the library properly organised and easily accessible. Audiotapes and CDs may include Qur&#8217;an recitation, lectures, and khutbahs, as well as tapes for children containing supplications, reminders of Islamic manners, and nasheeds (religious songs with no musical instruments).</p>
</div>

<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Switch off the box</strong></span></p>
<p>So much of what takes place on television is, at best, unnecessary audiovisual clutter and, at worst, harmful or damaging to our iman and development as Muslims. If you do have a TV, try to limit its use to necessary or beneficial viewing and resist the temptation to keep it on as background noise. Instead, why not tune into the Speech of Allah? What can be more beautiful to the ear and soothing to the soul than Allah&#8217;s words?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>No dogs inside please</strong></span></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Muslims can keep pets; we can even keep dogs. The companions of the Prophet (SAW) kept dogs for farming, etc. However, dogs must not be allowed into the house as Angels do not enter a home when there is a dog present. Also, care should be taken that the dog&#8217;s saliva or mucus does not get onto our clothes or body before we pray as it is impure and will invalidate our prayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Clean up your walls</strong></span></p>
<p>We know that Angels do not tread where there are pictures and figurines of human beings, animals, birds, etc present. As mentioned in the Sunnah, we should not have a replica, be it in print or object form of any animate being (a creature that possess a soul) in the house. Try substituting those wedding photos and portraits with landscapes, still life photography, abstract or Islamic art with no images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Now that you have some ideas on how to make your home more Islamic, which changes will you be making today?</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Oishee Alam talks to Farhat Amin about the path she has taken to change Muslim approaches to education and parenting for the bette]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>What was the reason behind starting The Muslim Sticker Company?</strong></span></em><br />
The impetus came when my eldest son started madrassah and I began homeschooling my daughter. I was eager to find out how the Prophet (SAW) raised his children and how he taught them about Islam. Every hadith I read described how loving, considerate and kind the Prophet (SAW) was towards his own children and he (SAW) instructed Muslim parents and teachers to be patient and compassionate when teaching children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I found there was an anomaly between the sunnah of the Prophet (SAW) and the reality of how some Muslim teachers taught Islam to their students. I could be accused of generalising here, however many sisters would agree that they do not have fond memories of the heavy-handed discipline meted out in Qur’an classes and madrassahs. Hence, I wanted to help Muslim parents and teachers educate and discipline their children in a positive way, rather than focusing on the negatives.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #33cccc;">What research did you carry out before beginning your endeavour?</span></em></strong><br />
I had worked in a state school and was impressed by the positive behaviour strategies that teachers used, i.e. reward stickers and badges, class reward charts, praise certificates and so on.  Commonly, the students were motivated to work and responded to positive feedback rather than being told off and reprimanded. At home, I was making my own Islamic behaviour chart and certificates. Initially, I looked for Islamic stickers that I could use but was unable to find any. Later, when I worked in an Islamic school I found that teachers faced the same problem and spent a ludicrous amount of time producing their own material. I was using stickers at home and school, but I wanted stickers with an Islamic focus and I suddenly realised that what I should do then was follow my instincts and design some myself. I used these products every day; I understood them. Therefore, I was in the position of the consumer and didn&#8217;t need to do tonnes of research; I was the target audience!<br />

Our products can be divided into three main categories. Firstly, resources that parents can use. There’s a Ramadhan chart, counting down the days of the holy month; a salah chart encouraging children to keep their five daily prayers; and my personal favourite is the Juz Amma tree, a wonderfully colourful and fun way to encourage young Muslims to memorise the final part of the Qur’an. We have 21 different types of sticker packs and the range includes stickers for Eid, good behaviour, girls, boys, salah and wudhu. The stickers are available in English, French and Arabic.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The second category is resources for teachers and home educators. This includes 3 types of teachers’ stickers and pre-inked stamps that make marking quick and easy, as well as badges, certificates and medals for special occasions, such as award assemblies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The third category is a new area we decided to branch into: decorations for Islamic festivals, i.e. Ramadhan, Eid, Hajj, Aqiqah, Umrah. As a parent, I wanted to make Ramadhan and Eid truly special and memorable for my own children and for the wider Muslim community. Via the company, I realised I could do that by producing Ramadhan bunting, Ramadan balloons, Eid bunting, Eid banners, Eid partyware, etc. I am constantly thinking of new additions! Living in a non-Muslim country, I think it’s so important to create a buzz and an exciting atmosphere in our homes during Ramadhan and Eid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #33cccc;">How do you come up with your ideas and designs?</span></em></strong><br />
I have been blessed with three very opinionated kids! And a posse of nieces and nephews as well. I always ask their opinion &#8211; my daughter has the final say on our girls’ stickers, and my sons chose the cars for the boys stickers. I do my market research on my nieces and nephews and their parents. They don’t hold back when it comes to giving me constructive criticism! Currently, I am working in a state school so if I find a resource that works well at school I make an Islamic version of it &#8211; that’s how I got the idea for our pre-inked stamps and new marking stickers for teachers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #33cccc;">­­­­­­What is the most rewarding aspect of running The Muslim Sticker Company?</span></em></strong><br />
I feel really pleased when mums and teachers tell me how our products have helped them motivate their children Islamically and when I see our stickers in shop windows and on Facebook pages. Our products are also sold internationally, in large retail stores and by sisters who sell them to other mothers via Facebook.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #33cccc;">What are your plans for the future?</span></em></strong><br />
I am designing a set of sticker activity books to help children understand the following topics: Allah is our Creator and Miracles of the Messengers. I have already uploaded educational videos for children on our Youtube channel, and would like to create some more.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Interior designer, Saudah Saleem offers clever tips for prepping your home for Ramadhan guests.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunset is fast approaching. The CD of Qur’anic recitation you hoped would serenade you until your guests arrived is on but is being drowned out by the sound of your children playing.  And while you’ve purchased the dates, have plenty of water on deck and have your family’s traditional Ramadhan dish simmering on the stove, you’re still scurrying around the house picking up toys, tucking away papers and magazines, trying to get the house in order.  Suddenly the doorbell rings! Iftar guests have arrived and you still haven’t got around to hiding those unsightly odds and ends!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
For Muslims around the world, in addition to fasting and prayer, Ramadhan also means entertaining family and friends in our homes. If the above scenario seems remotely familiar, the following tips are just what you need to get your iftar entertaining in order and take the stress out of pre-iftar cleanup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The early bird catches the worm</strong><br />
Get started on clean up 2-3 days before your iftar. This will allow you to pace yourself and avoid a last-minute frenzy. Use this time to finalise your table setting and décor and to make sure you have all the right ingredients, dishes and serving utensils you’ll need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Focus your cleaning efforts on the spots that matter</strong><br />
Nothing makes a house look more uninviting than clutter. To get rid of the clutter, take an empty laundry basket into the rooms you know your guests will see, pick up things that don&#8217;t belong and toss them into the basket. Stash the basket in a closet or somewhere guests won&#8217;t look. Don’t forget to put away any precious items that might get broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Invest in smart storage alternatives</strong><br />
Decorative storage boxes, trunks, storage ottomans, and wicker baskets with lids are all great alternative solutions for quickly hiding away clutter. They are multifunctional, serving as both decorative elements in your space and allowing you to disguise everything from children’s action figures and crafts to magazines and mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Make it a family affair</strong><br />
Get your family involved in prep for the iftar. Enlist the help of your kids and spouse. Have your children to help plan activities to keep guests’ children entertained during the iftar. Ask your husband to help with preparing the space or activities for men attending the iftar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hide the dirty dishes</strong><br />
If you have dirty dishes in the kitchen sink, load them all into the dishwasher to get them out of sight. Guests are coming to break their fast and don’t really want to see all the work and dirty dishes that went into making your scrumptious meal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget those extra touches!</strong><br />
Preparing your home for an iftar is more than just removing clutter. Use this opportunity to add simple touches that make your home comfortable and inviting to guests. Fresh flowers or a favourite fragranced candle are just right for welcoming guests. Remember to spritz upholstered furniture with fabric refresher and fluff pillows too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bathroom musts</strong><br />
Tidy up the bathroom. Usually, the cleaner you make the bathroom ahead of time, the cleaner your guests will feel they have to leave it. So be sure to make it look nice and neat. Remove everything from the bathroom but the essentials, leaving only fresh soap, guest towels, extra toilet tissue and a small bouquet of fresh flowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Make empty bins visible</strong><br />
People won’t necessarily go hunting for a bin when they have a pile of plates and cups to dispose of. If they don’t know where you normally keep your rubbish bin, they’re not going to make much effort to find it. Make sure you leave just a few empty bins visible to guests. Otherwise, you’ll be picking up half eaten dates and rice in different areas of the house days later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Make your home comfortable and welcoming for all guests</strong><br />
Before guests arrive, arrange the furniture as you’ll want it for the iftar. If men will be in one section of the home and women in another, make sure that guests can move easily from one part of your house to another to get to those designated areas. Depending on the amount of guests you’re expecting, figure out where your food, beverages, and desserts will go to avoid a traffic jam of guests. Also make sure that you have adequate seating and accommodation for all of the guests you’ve invited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Children matter too</strong><br />
Be sure to consider all members of the families you’ve invited when planning your iftar. Having colouring books, finger foods, snacks and games available is key to keeping little ones entertained and this allows adult guests to relax and have the memorable time you’ve planned for them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, it’s not uncommon to find urban modernity in home decorating by combining ecological furnishing with versatile, recyclable items to create an eclectic style statement. There are many ways to spruce up your home’s aesthetic, all while being kind to the environment. Nothing’s more eco-friendly than transforming old or unwanted items into something useful, or using everyday items to create green decorative elements. The only rule is to reduce, reuse and recycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Bottles and jars</strong></span><br />
Decorate empty jars with a coat of paint and add fancy embellishments such as buttons, glitter, old coins, rhinestones, labels or whatever else you have on hand. They can be used to store almost anything!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glass jars and bottles also make chic pot planters for an indoor herb garden. Plant some herbs in a few of these, line them up in a wooden box at your kitchen window and dress them up with paint or labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create cute bathroom accessories in a jiffy by filling glass containers with bath salts, bath gels and potpourri. Empty perfume bottles can also be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Tins and plastic</strong></span><br />
Plant small seedlings or flowers in plastic bottles that have been cut in half or tin cans. Add a coat of paint and place them outdoors or indoors to brighten up your surroundings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biscuit or sweet tins are great for storage, and smaller tins are ideal for keeping small-scale items like business cards or paper clips. Kids can also have fun making their own pencil holders by decorating empty tins (such as a Pringles tin).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Boxes and baskets</strong></span><br />
Cover empty tissue or shoe boxes with gift wrapping paper. Line them in your drawers or closet to organise items like socks, underwear, jewellery or make-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pill boxes with dividers for each day of the week are not only meant for your daily vitamins; they also make perfect storage organisers for tiny objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use old laundry or wicker baskets to store things such as books/magazines, towels or even pantry items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Wall art</strong></span><br />
Add some paint to a tray that you’re not using and hang it up on your wall by tying ribbon or strong cord to the handles of the tray so that it hangs like a frame. You could also paint it with chalkboard paint to make a notice board, which can be used as a menu planner, conversion chart for recipe measurements, to write emergency phone numbers on, or as way to organise your household chores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use old frames to make a dry-erase weekly planner with just a coat of paint and an erasable laminated calendar sheet on the inside where you’d normally put the picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foam board frames are neat DIY wall decorations. Mount foam board on your wall and decorate with items such as postcards to make a collage frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Creative crafts</strong></span><br />
Broken dishes, CDs and mirrors can be used to make your own mosaics by gluing the bits onto a piece of chipboard and applying a small amount of tile grout to the gaps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any item (whether glass, plastic, wood or metal) can be decoupaged, by gluing on paper clippings, pictures or designs that have been cut out of things like magazines and wrapping paper. Use thin white craft glue to coat the entire item and arrange your pictures over it. Let it dry, then add another coat of glue and decoupage sealer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Old clothing or linen can be made into small travel pillows by stitching them and stuffing them with cotton wool. They can also be cut up and sewn into dish rags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Natural embellishments</strong></span><br />
Pebbles or stones give an earthy look to any surrounding. Fill vases with them &#8211; you can even add branches or twigs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beach or desert sand (if you live near a beach or desert) adds an unusual decorative element. Portion out your sand into jars/bottles and add some coral or dried plants to create a unique natural scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Get organised</strong></span></p>
<p>Start by making a list of all the tasks you wish to complete. Then make a list of all the things you will need to complete those tasks and stock up on sponges, cleaning cloths and your preferred cleaning agent. Replace old mops and tired broom heads and treat your vacuum cleaner to a new bag. If that isn&#8217;t possible, empty the bag and clean the insides of the vacuum cleaner thoroughly. Get a few storage boxes to help your de-cluttering.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try not to plan too much action for one day. It is easy to unpack all your cupboards in a burst of enthusiasm then feel overwhelmed by the idea of sorting through it all &#8211; and ending up with more mess than you started with! So, pace yourself and resolve to complete one task a day until the house is in working order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Be systematic</strong></span></p>
<p>Make a list of all the rooms in your house and what tasks you wish to complete in each. That way you can cross off each task as you go along. If you decide to start with the bedrooms, your focus areas should be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Wardrobes</em></span></p>
<p>Sort through clothes and take out anything too warm, too small, soiled or damaged. Pack the warm clothes away if they won&#8217;t be needed. The same goes for clothes that your family has grown out of: either pack them away or give them to a family member, your local masjid or a clothing charity. Stained or soiled clothes should be washed or dry-cleaned and damaged garments should be mended or sent to a clothing recycle bin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 38">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Beds and mattresses</em></span></p>
<p>Vacuum or wash your mattresses, let them air and then turn them over. Give your pillows and duvets a wash if you can fit them in your machine. If not, take them to the launderette. Replace any pillows that have no life left in them. You may want to replace heavier duvets with lighter ones if that is appropriate in your climate. Be sure to vacuum under the beds and other pieces of furniture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Curtains and blinds</em></span></p>
<p>Vacuum any dust from your curtains and arrange to have them laundered or dry-cleaned. If you have blinds, dust them and wipe each slat with a damp cloth to get rid of dirt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Carpets and rugs</em></span></p>
<p>If you have rugs or throws in your bedrooms, machine wash or dry clean them, depending on manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Move furniture and vacuum wall-to-wall carpets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 38">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Your Living Room</em></span></p>
<p>Give your carpet a make-over by mixing 2 cups of cornmeal and 1 cup of borax. Sprinkle the mixture onto the carpet. Blot stubborn stains with vinegar in soapy water. Vacuum thoroughly after an hour. If you do not have carpets, clean your floor by mixing equal parts water and vinegar. Rinse and mop dry. The water-vinegar mixture is a great all-purpose cleaner that can be used for coffee tables and other wooden furniture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a sofa instead of wooden or rattan furniture, remove stains from the fabrics by applying a paste of lemon juice mixed with cream of tartar. The same can be done for the curtains. You windows will benefit from a good wash. Mix 1 cup of vinegar in a pail of water and wipe down with a cotton rag. Use crumpled newspaper to scrub the glass for a surprisingly bright sheen.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Your Dining Area</em></span></p>
<p>Half a cup of borax mixed into a gallon of water will disinfect and deodorize your dining table, buffet tables and the floor under the table. Alternatively, if you need to scrub a little more into the area, use baking soda with water as baking soda is mildly abrasive and will scrub without scratching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Your Kitchen</em></span></p>
<p>Baking soda on a damp cloth is perfect to clean bench tops, sinks, windows and your refrigerator or freezer surfaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Baking soda added to water will help you clean out the oven, microwave and stove. Apply the paste to all the required surfaces (avoid wires and heating elements) and use a scouring pad to scrub where grime has accumulated. Use a damp sponge for other places. Rinse thoroughly afterwards. If you are cleaning the oven daily and stains are still fresh, dampen them with a warm cloth. Sprinkle salt over the stains and scrape them off when your oven cools down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combat nasty smells from your garbage disposal, grind ice and lemon juice in the disposal. Similarly, sprinkling baking soda at the bottom of rubbish bins will do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Your Bedrooms</em></span></p>
<p>Mirrors can be wiped down with warm water and a lint-free cotton rag. Adding 1⁄4 of white vinegar and water in a bottle spray will give your reflection that extra shine. Rinse well and squeeze dry. You can use the crumpled newspaper tip on mirrors as well as windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Your Bathrooms</em></span></p>
<p>The bath tub, shower and sink can be scrubbed down after sprinkling baking soda onto the porcelain surfaces. After a good scrub, rub down the fixtures with a wet rag. Rinse well in order to avoid a hazy film.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The perfect toilet bowl cleaner would start with 1 cup of vinegar being poured down into the bowl. Add a handful of baking soda and watch the solution turn into a fizz. Scrub well after twenty minutes or so. Alternatively, use borax on stubborn stains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tried and tested vinegar plus water formula will help you mop up your bathroom floor.</p>

<p><em>These little fellas can help you save money and energy, and they&#8217;re super cute! Pop the cacti in your tumble dryer so they can disperse the wet clothes and promote efficient circulation of heat and removal of moisture. The spikes on the cacti gentle pamper the fabrics as they tumble, making them fluffier and reducing static. A great way to control dryer static and to naturally soften your clothes. </em></p>

<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Bread Maker &#8211; EUR 30</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5661" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_688377-1024x768.jpg" alt="designist_688377" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_688377-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_688377-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_688377-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>

<p><em>Have you ever wanted to make your own bread and thought &#8216;it&#8217;s just too much hassle&#8217;? Well, with this awesome kit from Lekue it couldn&#8217;t be easier. With the Bread Maker, you can weigh, knead and bake all in the one receptacle. So now you can bake bread the traditional way, except it will be faster, cleaner and take up less space in the kitchen. The bowl is designed so it&#8217;s partially closed when you&#8217;re baking, allowing steam to circulate, which makes the dough moist and prevents your bread from drying out. The side openings allow the hot air to circulate, which gives your bread a crusty and golden texture. Made from platinum silicone, it&#8217;s designed to withstand high temperatures in ovens microwaves and dishwashers, and it can be reused as many times as needed. The kits comes with a dishwasher safe spatula, instruction booklet and recipes for 6-Grain bread and Quick No-Knead Bread. Made from platinum silicon material which is easy to clean and repels water and germs. It&#8217;s a highly hygienic and dishwasher friendly material.</em></p>

<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Fermentation Crock &#8211; EUR 39</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5663" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_706511-1024x681.jpg" alt="designist_706511" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_706511-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_706511-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_706511-1024x681.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fermentation is all the rage these days, but what exactly is it? It&#8217;s a way of preserving fresh vegetables whilst increasing their nutritional content at the same time. The action of the bacteria created during fermentation helps the body absorb the minerals in the food faster. The bacteria also produce vitamins and enzymes that are beneficial for digestion. You don&#8217;t need much equipment-wise to ferment your own vegetables, but having the correct crock pot can make all the difference when you&#8217;re getting started. This crock pot provides a special anaerobic (without air) fermenting environment. It allows the lactic-acid bacteria to work best and prevents yeasts and moulds which can ruin your ferment and make your food taste gross. This 2 litre kit has everything you need to start making your own pickles at home: a durable, cleverly designed fermentation crock, a re-writable label to identify each batch, and a booklet of user-friendly, thoroughly tested recipes to get you started.</em></p>

<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Eden Suction Planter &#8211; EUR 17.50</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5662" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_690449-872x1024.jpg" alt="designist_690449" width="872" height="1024" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_690449-768x902.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_690449-872x1024.jpg 872w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" /></p>

So your plants get way more light, and they are in sight at all times, absolute genius. Ideal for herbs in the kitchen, they are easy to install and easy to remove. You really need to use it to believe it, but they come with a secure and powerful suction (the Oki-Lock system) and it also incorporates a water reservoir system.</p>

<p><span style="color: #c90e0e;"><strong>Sugru &#8211; EUR 10</strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5660" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_682640-1024x682.jpg" alt="designist_682640" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_682640-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_682640-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/designist_682640-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This really is wonderstuff! Sugru is like modeling clay when you take it from its pack. Once it&#8217;s exposed to air, it cures to a tough flexible silicone overnight using the moisture in the air. Working time = 30 mins. Cure time = 24hrs. It can be used for mending, re-modelling, improving and personalising your things. When sugru cures, it&#8217;s flexible rather than rigid. Which means that you can repair things that need to be able to move like textiles, cables, or shoes. Sugru is designed to stick to as many other materials as possible. It forms a strong bond to aluminium, steel, ceramics, glass and other materials including plastics like perspex.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you have a large or tiny bedroom, a headboard can instantly become the focal point of your room, boosting its overall wow factor. If you want a headboard that is truly unique, you can display your creativity with an innovative, personalised DIY headboard. Now, wouldn’t that be much cooler than one from a showroom?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many incredible headboard ideas out there: a framed canvas, curtain panels, barnyard planks, mirrors, doors, photo frames, wallpapers, stencils, you name it – all have the potential to become a personalised headboard. Let your imagination fly. Depending on your creative ingenuity, DIY headboards will almost always save you money, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Custom headboards retail for big bucks but it is easy to get a customised look with a little creativity. We had a piece of wood lying around from our first apartment which had sentimental value, and we didn’t want to throw it away. After much thought we turned it into a headboard for one of our guest bedrooms. My guests love waking up to a chic bedroom with a boutique style headboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on budget, use wood, plywood or MDF (medium-density fiberboard) if you want to recreate this exact headboard or one similar to it by adding your own spin. The headboard has three parts &#8211; a main panel with two upholstered side panels. We like clean straight lines, but you can customise yours by adding curvy lines if that’s more of your style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the fabric, you can choose satin, silk, velvet, a cotton/polyester blend, or practically any upholstery weight fabric. It really depends on the look you are trying to achieve. I used an old sari that had the perfect bright and cheery colours I was going for for the guest room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The level of difficulty to make this headboard in a day is moderate. If you get all your wood pieces cut at the home improvement store when buying the supplies, some of you may even rate this project as easy. One person can finish the job but it’s always great to have a husband, sibling or friend alongside while putting all the pieces together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The headboard can easily be constructed in one day. I would recommend buying your supplies ahead of the day you will be making the headboard. Make sure you have all your measurements and know what kind of fabric, pattern and colours you want before setting out for the shops. It will be a busy day, so you don’t want to waste time at the store looking at hundreds of options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to attach your headboard to the wall or bed. We attached the headboard to the bed frame using bolts. Many attach the finished headboard to the wall using construction grade glues or mount using cleats. Use the method that’s convenient and practical for you and your space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine the size of the headboard and upholstered side panels, measure from the lower edge of the bed frame to the height you would like for your headboard height and add six inches to it to determine the headboard height (H). The length (L) of your bed frame is the length of the headboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the two upholstered panels, decide the shape (square, rectangle, triangle, hexagon, etc.) and the length (L1) and height (H1) you want.  For the sake of clarity, let&#8217;s assume the panels to be of rectangular shape in this article.  Add 12 inches to the four sides of the rectangle to determine the fabric size. Note the fabric height (H2 = H1 + 24 inches) and length (L2 = L1 + 24 inches) for the fabric. You can choose to buy two H2 x L2 pieces of fabric or double the length (L2) to buy one piece. In the latter case, you’ll have to cut the fabric into two pieces for the two side panels. Similarly, if you chose a triangular panel, you would need to add 12 inches to three sides to determine your fabric size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Materials</strong></span><br />
• H x L x 1” thick headboard panel made of wood, plywood or MDF (1)<br />
• L x 2“ thick x 4“ high wood or plywood board (1)<br />
• Sandpaper<br />
• Paint or stain of your choice<br />
• H1 x L1 x 1&#8243; thick side panel (2)<br />
• H1 x L1 x 2&#8243; thick density foam (2)<br />
• H2 x L2 fabric of your choice (2)<br />
• H2 x L2 standard quilting batting<br />
• 2&#8243; screws (4)<br />
• 2 ½” bolts (4)<br />
• Screwdriver<br />
• Staple gun<br />
• Iron<br />
• Fabric scissors<br />
• Fabric glue<br />
• Fabric marker<br />
• Tape measure<br />
• Hammer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Instructions</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><em>1. Prepare main headboard panel</em></span><br />
Sand the main panel to smooth any rough edges. Stain or paint panel and set it aside. Stain or paint the 2&#215;4 board and set aside. Iron each piece of fabric.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>2. Construct upholstered side panels</em></span><br />
Line each side panel with foam. Spread batting over foam and frame leaving excess on all sides. With your staple gun, staple the batting securely to the wood, pulling the batting tight so it is not loose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Centre fabric over batting and frame with excess extending beyond all sides. Adjust fabric placement to ensure pattern is equal on left and right of the side panels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fold excess batting and fabric under the frame at each corner to create a clean corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fold fabric over back of frame and using the staple gun, staple trim along to secure. To create a placement guide for the staples, you may want to draw a straight line with fabric marker. Continue stapling until a border around the entire panel is created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>3. Attach upholstered side panels to main headboard panel</em></span><br />
Determine the placement of the side panels. We placed ours in a way so that there are four inches above the main headboard. Apply heavy-duty construction adhesive to back of side panels. Attach to the headboard and let glue set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>4. Attach headboard to bed frame</em></span><br />
The 2&#215;4 wood or plywood board attaches the headboard to the bed.  Attach the board to the bottom of the headboard using 4 screws. Secure your headboard to the bed frame firmly using bolts between the bed frame and the 2X4 board attached to the headboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Your bed is ready to use as soon as the headboard is secure. Decorative accent pillows will always add interesting depth and colour to your finished headboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Happy DIYing and snoozing!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m drowning most of the time. There is even an official term for the way I live my life: Motherhood. As a mum of three, my life is hectic. Throw in the fact that I work from home, and I rarely get a minute to myself. Despite my better judgement, I seem to thrive off having multiple projects on the go at any given time. As nonsensical as this seems, I know I am not alone. Motherhood is a time of life when you find yourself confused, sleep-deprived and overwhelmed. There are so many tasks that need completing and people who need pleasing, that it can be impossible to keep track of it all. What&#8217;s worse, all those little things YOU need keep getting pushed to the bottom of your priority list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I often find myself overwhelmed by demands and unfinished jobs. I was losing track of valuable projects and completing forgetting essential tasks. Life was getting rough, and I was neglecting myself in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then came Pinterest. Pinterest is a dangerous realm of impossibilities. I was taunted with immaculate home decor, complex D.I.Y activities for children and mouth-watering kitchen masterpieces. Pinterest had quickly become a cruel tease for the drowning mother&#8230; Until I found some posts about paper planning!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You hear terms like &#8216;Filofax&#8217; and &#8216;Project Planning&#8217;, and you can&#8217;t help but picture a stuffy office, people in suits with hefty portfolios spread open, overflowing with notes. But that was yesteryear. Now, the average Filofax owner carries a magnitude of colourful pens, cute stickers and fancy deco tape. A Typical Filofax owner can be a stay at home mum who loves to read and take her kids on playdates at the park. I was inspired by the variety of ways people were using weekly planners and diaries to organise their goals and dreams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I have tried and tested a variety of planners and methods in order to find the best possible fit for my life. The most incredible part of this ever-changing planning system is that each method was appropriate for that stage of my life. When I moved back to my mum’s house before I had my third child, I wasn’t working as much, I wasn’t organising a household, and I was rarely in control of my schedule! For this reason, I was able to put aside my bulging A5 Filofax and pull out a simple notebook to keep a daily track of my priorities in the lead up to my due date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a paper planner has not only brought relative peace to my hectic life, but it has also been a thoroughly enjoyable process, one that changes constantly according to the demands of my life. My planner has become my life jacket, and without it, I am back to floundering amongst the chaos of housework and unsatisfied children!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up a planner can be tricky, so here are some tips to bear in mind:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #944f00;"><strong>Main sections</strong></span></p>
<p>What goes into your planner should be unique. We all live our own individual lives, and your planner should reflect that. However, there are some features that are common appearances in most planners:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #944f00;"><strong>1) Monthly calendar</strong></span><br />
These come in a wide range of formats, and it depends what suits you best. Personally, I prefer a grid across two pages. Although, others prefer to have their entire month on one page. Some people opt out of a grid format entirely and prefer a vertical list with each day of the month on a single line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #944f00;"><strong>2) Weekly calendar</strong></span><br />
Again, the number of formats available for a weekly calendar are pretty extensive. Rather than vertical columns for each day, I have always preferred each day horizontally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #944f00;"><strong>3) To do lists</strong></span><br />
You can organise these lists into categories. This helps you see how much time you are devoting to each area of your life. Often, we fill our time with household tasks and work-related tasks, and we end up neglecting other aspects of ourselves. In my planner I have different sections for tasks:<br />
Children<br />
Home<br />
Work<br />
Spiritual<br />
Personal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #944f00;"><strong>Purge your mind!</strong></span><br />
One of the biggest obstacles to our productivity is our mind. Often we find ourselves unable to focus on one task because we are too busy worrying about all the other tasks we need to get round to. When this happens, not only are we less likely to perform successfully, but we also leave tasks incomplete as we attempt to handle several projects at once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So sit down, grab a pen and paper, and write down everything you need to do. Whether it&#8217;s a big task or small, write it down. For example, &#8216;clean fridge&#8217; or even &#8216;write article&#8217; . The aim is to get everything down on paper so it isn&#8217;t cluttering your mind and hindering your progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #944f00;"><strong>Break it down &#8211; plan it out!</strong></span><br />
Now you have your Master To Do list, it&#8217;s time to sift through and split any big tasks into a step by step process. For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write article<br />
Plan main points<br />
Research<br />
Rough draft<br />
Edit draft<br />
Format and finalise<br />
Submit article</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could even break these down further. You may only have 10 minutes a day to work on your article, so break it down in a way that each task can be completed in just 10 minutes. This way, you are more likely to see a project through to the end, even if it takes a little longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #944f00;"><strong>Spread it out</strong></span><br />
Now you have all your small tasks, they can be spread across each day or even spread through each month. After putting all your appointments, events and deadlines onto your calendars, you will have a clear view of your free time. Distribute your tasks and projects across your week, deciding where best to put each task. Remember, those bigger projects were split into bite size chunks for a reason &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to complete them all at once!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #944f00;"><strong>Other sections</strong></span><br />
Adding extra sections to your planner depends on you. I prefer to have a section for household notes like maintenance and meal plans. Another section I find useful is a &#8216;Work&#8217; section which holds all my deadlines in one place, along with relevant notes and contacts for each project. Some mothers have a &#8216;School&#8217; section to hold together any information for their child&#8217;s school events and holidays. Another idea is to have a &#8216;Reading&#8217; section to keep track of the books you&#8217;re working through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The possibilities are completely up to you &#8211; whatever makes your life easier!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #944f00;"><strong>Decorate!</strong></span></p>
<p>This step is completely optional. A lot of planner users aren&#8217;t a big fan of stickers and fancy colour codes, whilst other users only have a planner so that they can decorate. But one goal is in mind: enjoy your planner. If your planner doesn&#8217;t make you feel good when you open it, you&#8217;re less likely to use it. Whether you want to use colourful stickers or fancy deco tape, decorating your planner can be both enjoyable and functional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all it takes to set up a paper planner. Although, you may find yourself regularly adjusting and reshuffling your planner as your life evolves and your demands change. Either way, having somewhere to collect everything that goes on in your life is a breath of fresh air during those chaotic times in your life! How you format and arrange your planner is completely up to you. Browse online for ideas &#8211; seeing how other people have set up their planners is always a great way to get ideas and inspiration. Try it out, and believe me, you&#8217;ll wonder how on earth you coped before!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #c47ec4;"><strong><em>OA: What inspired you to start Muslim Gift Guide?</em></strong></span><br />
MGG: In the past, “Islamic products” meant poor quality or compromised designs. In the last few years, we’ve seen an incredible global flourish of creative Muslim entrepreneurs producing beautiful products and launching wonderful brands. Peter Gould, founder of Muslim Gift Guide, intended to build his new website as a platform to showcase and highlight the best examples of these Islamic products and inspire others to collectively improve the global standard. Naturally, it became a great place to find thoughtful gifts as well!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c47ec4;"><em><strong>OA: Tell me a little about Muslim Gift Guide &#8211; what is it, and how does it work?</strong></em></span><br />
MGG: MuslimGiftGuide.com is our online directory showcasing the coolest gift ideas for Muslims, insha Allah!  We believe in showcasing creativity, beauty and quality design, and encouraging and inspiring designers, brands and entrepreneurs to deliver outstanding product experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit our website, you are welcomed by a beautifully curated collection of fine products created by the Ummah. Muslim Gift Guide has gift ideas for just about anyone &#8211; so if you are looking for something special for a specific person, we have plenty of fun and relevant categories to choose from such as Mister Hipster, Cool Hijabis, Little Prince (or Princess) and Serious Food &#8211; to name a few!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
You can seamlessly browse each category for the perfect gift, and if you really like something you find on Muslim Gift Guide, we also provide links where you can make your purchases off-site from the respective sellers and their online stores. Currently, we do not sell any products on our website but instead focus the spotlight on great brands and products in one place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We have a great team of MGG contributors who are always on the lookout for awesome products to feature. We couldn’t do it without them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #c47ec4;"><strong><em>OA: The gifts you feature are indeed very special, masha Allah! What other cool projects does Muslim Gift Guide have on the go?</em></strong></span><br />
MGG: We launched a new blog this past Ramadhan, and we intend to provide useful articles geared towards aspiring creative entrepreneurs and individuals through it. This is where we want to get your creativity churning! You don’t necessarily have to have a business to chime in. The content is to benefit anyone who reads it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We have a talented team of Guest Contributors from various industries who share their passions through writing about fun project tutorials, reflective posts, beneficial entrepreneurial tips and more. We are hoping to build this space into a supportive online community where people can help to uplift one another in their creative endeavours and pursuits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We also have a special monthly segment on the blog called “Creative Spotlight” in which we interview the creatives behind the beautiful brands we feature on Muslim Gift Guide. We want it to be a source of inspiration for other aspiring entrepreneurs. The Creative Spotlight gives a chance for the creatives to share their story with the world through dialogue and behind-the-scene photographs of their process so the readers can get to know them personally. It’s about making connections and humanising the businesses. It’s also motivating for others who are considering entering the creative field featured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We are currently in the works of adding cooler features to benefit our readers, so stay tuned for what’s  to come in the near future, insha Allah!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #c47ec4;"><em><strong>OA: Who is Muslim Gift Guide geared towards?</strong></em></span><br />
MGG: We hope it will benefit many people by showcasing the Ummah’s best brands and products in one place. It aims to link discerning shoppers with businesses around the planet, and inspire entrepreneurs and young people to design high quality experiences for consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #c47ec4;"><em><strong>OA: What do you look for when you&#8217;re searching for products to feature?</strong></em></span><br />
MGG: We feature products based on design, creativity, beauty and quality. We look for unique products which are masterfully designed and beautifully created, down to the fine details. To us, this means meticulous planning, thought and consideration in producing the item, with the goal of solving their consumer’s problem as priority. We also look for bright, sharp product photographs which leave the impression of an exemplary, professional product. If you know of a great brand you feel suits our MGG criteria, let us know about it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c47ec4;"><em><strong>OA: What has contributed to the expansion of Muslim entrepreneurship around the world?</strong></em></span><br />
MGG: There are two main reasons. Firstly, we&#8217;ve had a whole generation of existing creative individuals and entrepreneurs come online to share the work they’ve been involved with for a longer period of time, but perhaps only shared with their local or regional communities until recently. At the same time, we have a new wave of aspiring entrepreneurs creating beautiful fresh work and products. There are a lot more active discussions, support and initiatives around startups in Muslim communities, and far fewer barriers to international success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c47ec4;"><em><strong>OA: What has the response to Muslim Gift Guide been so far?</strong></em></span><br />
MGG: We have visitors of all walks of life and faiths on our website. The positive response has been incredibly encouraging from consumers, eager for a greater variety and quality of “Islamic” products, to small business owners, looking to be recognised in the noisy, saturated market. We received comments like, “Masha Allah! Loving it. What a brilliant way to support Muslim entrepreneurs!” to heartfelt du’as such as “LOVE this website! Masha Allah what a great start… I pray this project grows bigger and better than ever.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other similar feedback has surpassed our expectations, alhamdulillah, and we hope to continue to grow the website into something even greater, insha Allah! It’s our way of giving back to the Ummah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Umm Ibraheem discusses how to go about establishing a coffee morning in your area.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having just moved into a new area, I found there were not many social activities for women and mothers in particular, in the weekdays. So I decided to start coffee mornings as a way to meet sisters and was advised on how to do so by my sister who was already running coffee mornings in Luton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a two-bedroom flat and as the living room us small, I clear a few things from the larger bedroom in order to accommodate everyone with children, but sometimes the living room is sufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll always remember my first one, two sisters came and I was too shy to do the little reminder I prepared, and not at all sure it would take off. Alhumdulillah, within a few months, we were rotating between three homes, every other week!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>HOW TO START</strong></span></p>
<p>1. Get your husband’s support and if you live with in-laws think about whether it’s a sensible idea or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Choose a day and time that is convenient for you and will suit other sisters. Be realistic. The ‘original’ Luton Coffee mornings ran from 9.30-11.30, so mums could drop in on their way back from the school run, finishing in time to get home for lunch. This was too early for our mums! So we decided on 10.30- 12.30 on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Decide on frequency. The Luton ones were in the same home once a month. Ours are every other week but as it&#8217;s in three homes, each sister is doing them once every 6 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Think of a few sisters you would like to invite, to start with it doesn’t matter if it’s small. As word gets out, the numbers will increase, insha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Encourage those sisters attending to inform you of any other sisters they know who would benefit from being invited, especially divorced sisters or reverts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Make it clear that the coffee morning is a closed event and it is by invitation only. As it is in your home, you will want to know who is coming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>WHAT WE DO</strong></span></p>
<p>1.Texting seems the best way to invite sisters. Emails don’t always get read in time and phoning is time consuming. A few days before the next coffee morning, the host sister sends out text messages, and rings anyone who only has a land line. I store all the numbers on my phone under ‘Coffee mornings group’ and the text is sent to all sisters in that group. For example, &#8220;Asalaamu alaikum. I would like to invite you to a coffee morning at 300 Milton Rd., Leyton E10. on Wednesday 16th Jan. from 10.30-12.30. Please confirm attendance asap.&#8221;</p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. You can invite more sisters than you think will attend, as it is rare that everyone will make it. Try to invite sisters from a variety of backgrounds and ages, in particular those who could really do with the social interaction. Although we do not exclude anyone, we did decide that we would prioritise inviting local sisters, as the idea behind the coffee morning is to build a local social network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If you know a sister who can do a short reminder for you, ask her, otherwise you can read something simple out of a book or internet article or have a discussion topic prepared. It’s not essential to have a reminder, but remembrance of Allah in some form is important as it prevents you wasting time or backbiting. Do keep it short though, as this is not a circle and you want to socialise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 29">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Keep the food simple. Snacks, tea and biscuits or cake are sufficient. If you enjoy baking then go ahead, but out of a packet is fine! It’s important not to make food the centre of the coffee morning as it puts unnecessary pressure on the host and will put sisters off wanting to host as they may not think their culinary skills quite match Delia Smith or Martha Stewart!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>ON THE DAY</strong></span></p>
<p>Put away any ‘precious’ toys or anything that can become ‘messy’ as children won’t always be supervised. Give the sisters half an hour to arrive and settle. Do the reminder if you’re having one. Put the kettle on and get out the refreshments, use paper plates if you want, and as they say &#8211; chill and chat! As time goes on, other sisters may volunteer to host with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 29">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Generally it is better to cancel the coffee mornings during school holidays as it can become too much to handle with all the children. Having said that, the host sisters of our group felt it would be good for their kids if we kept going over the summer. So we actually ran it every week and it was a great success, masha Allah.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>WHY DO IT?</strong></span></p>
<p>1. Women need social interaction and a place to share ideas and support. Alhamdulillah, we’ve had discussions on breastfeeding, schooling, hijrah, sleeping problems with babies, toilet training, family relationships, behaviour problems in children and ideas on how to do da’wah. And of course, we’ve swapped some recipes too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. We need to build up our communities and get to know each other. We may see each other at talks or at the school gate and find it hard to initiate conversation; inviting a sister to a coffee morning is a good way to break the ice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. A coffee morning is an easy way to invite sisters to your house if you&#8217;re not able to invite them for a full meal for whatever reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Much good can come out of a coffee morning, A sister can leave with some much needed advice, a sister who hasn&#8217;t seen anyone all week can feel uplifted and people can form new friendships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Veteran mover Safa Ouhib hands out the hints she has picked up over years of packing and picking up boxes.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It started when I was ten years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s been well lived in,” was my mother’s euphemistic description of our new house. This was my first move, and at the age of ten I did not fully understand what she meant. I soon found out &#8211; together with the meaning of the term ‘elbow grease’!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, some of our family’s preparations made the move easier. Wrapping all breakables well, for example, ensured that we arrived at our new home with ornaments and china, if not sanity, intact!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My house moving experience broadened after getting married; my husband and I lived in six different flats in the first four years. Moves sometimes coincided with big projects at university and these were stressful times. Through all that moving, I hope I picked up some useful tips along the way to help you make your move as pleasant as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>In advance  </strong></span><br />
1. Take your move as an opportunity to do a big clear out, donating to charity or recycling where appropriate. It’s annoying and a waste of time and energy to pack and move things that you will end up getting rid of when unpacking in your new house &#8211; be ruthless! Start this process well in advance as it always seems to take longer than you’d imagined to pack everything up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Know whether things like curtains, carpets, and light fittings are staying or whether you need to bring or buy your own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Cancel phone and internet contracts well in advance if you have them and arrange for new ones to be set up at your new address. Although it’s worth mentioning that it is usually not possible to set up new contracts until you have actually moved. You may be without internet access for some weeks. If you rely on this, especially if you work from home, think about how you will cope and make alternative arrangements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Collect boxes from supermarkets and DIY or electrical shops as they are often willing to let you take ones in various sizes and strengths. Keep stronger ones for heavier items. Usually the boxes have been flattened and you need to reassemble them yourself using strong tape &#8211; layer the tape well. I usually do a few layers on the inside and outside of the box &#8211; the last thing you want is your possessions falling out the bottom! Wrap all breakables well and mark boxes clearly as FRAGILE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. As you pack, number the boxes and keep an inventory of what went into each box. This way, you pack the items that are used the least and work your way up to those you use frequently &#8211; and when you unpack, you will know to start with the highest number and work your way down. Keeping an inventory is especially important if you are moving to a different town or country, so that if a box goes missing or gets damaged, you will be able to remember what the contents were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Decide what each room in your new house is going to be used for and which bedrooms people are going to take. This way you can label boxes accordingly. Consider colour-coding the boxes with stickers or markers &#8211; using the colour red for all the boxes that contain kitchen goods, for example. In the new house, place a sticker or page with that colour on the door of the room so that the movers will know which boxes should be placed in which room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Have more boxes, markers and tape than you think you will need. Remember to label the sides of the boxes, not just the tops, as it will be difficult to read the label if other boxes are stacked on top of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. If you have older children involve them in the moving process. They can help to pack their clothes and toys for example. It helps to decide beforehand which bedrooms kids are going to take. I remember my mum drawing a little plan of our new house and we decided who would take each bedroom. This definitely avoided squabbles on moving day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Think about the layout of your new house and plan where bulky items like beds and couches will go, bear in mind that things like the washing machine, computer and phone will probably have to go into pre-existing fixtures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Remember to have phone numbers for your gas and electricity supplier so you can inform them of the move and take meter readings on the day you move out so you will not be billed for any fuel you have not used. Also take meter readings when you move to your new home and phone the relevant suppliers with these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. It is useful to have a few frozen meals prepared, transfer them to the new house in a cool box and then put them in the freezer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. If your new house is unoccupied, try to arrange for yourself and maybe a few family and friends to go there before the moving day and give it a good clean as this can save valuable time on the day.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">On the day  </span></strong><br />
13. Arrange for younger children to be looked after if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14. Older children may like to stay with friends while the contents of your old house is being packed up. They will almost certainly want to be involved in unpacking at the new house so they are less likely to get bored as the day wears on if they have been doing something else in the morning. Assign older children some age appropriate tasks &#8211; they could make a start at unpacking their bedroom or do some cleaning if necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15. Accept all the help you can get! If family and friends are helping out with the move, treat everyone to pizza or whatever else you can buy through take-out, rather than attempting to cook a meal that first day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16. If you are moving in town, instead of packing clothes into suitcases, simply remove them from the cupboards while still on the hangers, wrap them up in sheets and rehang straight into the wardrobes of your new house. Not only does this save time in packing, it causes few creases and saves you on the subsequent ironing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Aftermath  </span></strong><br />
17. Be prepared to live out of boxes for a while. Bear in mind that it will take time to get everything the way you want it (if this ever really happens) and it is normal to feel unsettled. Talk to your kids about this too if they are feeling unnerved by the changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We made our last move about six weeks before our son was born. When my husband broke the news that we had to leave our flat, to my shame, I cried. However, we’re still here over two years later, alhamdulillah! And, at the end of the day, experiences like moving house, having to let go of possessions, saying goodbye, are all tests which we can choose to embrace insha Allah. They are, after all, only small challenges on our journey to our real home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Safa Ouhib is an Irish revert who left her native Dublin after getting married, and spent the next few years moving from flat to flat in Edinburgh. She is now settled in Falkirk, Scotland. She hopes her moving days are not behind her though, as hijrah to Algeria is her next dream move.   </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer is here! It&#8217;s time to throw open the doors and windows of your home to a little summer loving! Make the most of the long, hot days and the sultry evenings by adding a little summer romance into your home and rekindle the emotional connection with your hubby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Flirtatious Florals</span> </strong><br />
Nothing says summer like a stunning fresh flower arrangement. Make use of the abundant flowers that are available by mixing colours, shapes and<br />
fragrances for a cheerful look. Think along the lines of pink or white carnations, yellow sunflowers and vibrant orange tulips abundant and lush freesias<br />
with blooms cascading over the edge of the vase or container. Alternatively, go for the glamour of red roses or the simple beauty of orchids in a<br />
statement vase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Seductive Sheers</span> </strong><br />
It’s time to take down those dark, thick winter drapes that trap heat and put up some airy, lightweight curtains to make the most of the longer days. Try out different pastel shades like baby pink, mint green or sky blue or go with neutrals like cream and camel. Keep window treatments simple to accentuate the view outside or dress them up with gathered fabric, swags and tie-backs. Sheers are wonderful for summer no matter what style you choose as they add a whimsical romantic feel to any room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Candescent Candles  </strong></span><br />
Candles are popular as a form of aromatherapy and you can choose from different shapes, colours or scents. During the day, cinnamon-scented<br />
candles can evoke the lovely smell of home baking. At the end of a warm evening try lighting aromatic candles with the sensual scents of ylang ylang,<br />
lavender, rose, sandalwood and vanilla to add a romantic ambience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Plush Pillows</span> </strong><br />
The vibrant accessories of plush pillows or colourful cushions look great in a room already filled with the flood of sunshine and the fragrance of flowers. You can even sew vibrant coloured cushion covers especially for the season that will add style and a creative touch to any room.</p>

<p>What with the demands of home and family, work and study, what better place to seek comfort and solace (or just some peace and quiet) than in the room you share with your loved one? With a few simple changes and additions, you too can have a bedroom that is a feast for all five senses and a welcome refuge at the end of a busy day.</p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>A clean, neat, clutter-free space is like a blank canvas just waiting to be made as visually appealing as you like. Decide on the kind of vibe you would like to create and choose your colour scheme accordingly: neutral tones like cream, oatmeal and beige create a calm and soothing atmosphere whereas reds, pinks and purples can create a more luxurious ambience. Go for a co-ordinated look with your bed linen and ring the changes with different colour throws, cushions or curtain tie-backs. These little changes can make all the difference.</p>

<p>Fabrics such as silk, linen, satin and velvet all add an air of luxury and comfort to your bedroom. You can make or buy cushion covers, bedspreads or throws to complement your bed linen. Try a selection of cushions in contrasting colours or mix and match rougher textures (corded linen, corduroy, raw silk) with smoother ones (velvet, faux fur, satin) for an exciting sensory experience.</p>

<p>If you want to make your bedroom a romantic retreat, scent it accordingly. Use essential oils, incense or scented candles to create the atmosphere you want. Essential oils can be burnt in an oil burner or simply added to a cup of hot water to gently perfume the air around you.</p>

<p>Your bedroom should be a tranquil, blessed space and there is nothing better than reciting or playing Qur&#8217;an to achieve this. Make reciting Qur&#8217;an in your bedroom after Fajr or before going to bed a daily habit and enjoy the benefits to your iman and the atmosphere in your room.</p>

<p>Try to keep outside noise to a minimum &#8211; limit the radio and TV so that you have the peace and quiet you crave, have space to talk to your hubby and can get a good night&#8217;s sleep. If you are looking for mood-enhancing sounds or need to wind down before bed, play CDs with natural sounds like birdsong, flowing water or waves (Search online for CDs of natural sounds or try Amazon&#8217;s wide selection).</p>

<p>Tantalise your taste buds in your private haven by sharing mugs of hot chocolate before bed. If you are watching your figure, try a tasty herb or fruit tea with wholesome honey or a long cool drink on a summer night.</p>
