		<description><![CDATA[In the latest installment of Musings of a Foodie, Fatima Bheekoo-Shah chats about her favourite meal of the day.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have all heard the saying that breakfast is the most important meal of day. It is also my favourite meal of the day. I have to admit in my younger years I was never a morning person. I wanted silence and a good cup of Joe before I spoke a word to anyone. My husband changed that. He is very much a morning person and has this infectious way of being cheery and happy in the mornings that I would like to think has rubbed off on me over the years. There is just something about waking up to a new day, a new start and waking up to breakfast. I have a deep love and respect for breakfast. It helps wake up my brain, fuel my body and gets things started on the right note. Food, or the absence of it, is so closely linked to my mood that if I skip breakfast you might find me in tears by lunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, breakfast is also the most versatile meal of the day for me. There is so much one can do for breakfast. From muesli, porridge, yoghurt, fruit, muffins, eggs, pancakes and even leftover food from the night before. I am by no means a breakfast traditionalist though. While I can get down with all of the usual breakfast fare, I do not limit the first meal of the day to eggs, pancakes, granola or other breakfast-y things. I’ve been known to root through the fridge in the morning, dig out the remains of a rib eye steak or a bbq lamb chop and eat it cold off the bone. I tend to listen to my body and feed it what it wants, even if it gets weird. Go with your gut, right? And sometimes my gut tells me to break an egg in last night’s curry and mop that up with some crisp sourdough bread or leftover flat breads. And cake for breakfast is something I do eat on occasion and think is totally acceptable. However, I don’t do cereal, ever. I cannot understand how people can have boring old cereal most mornings. Even as a child I remember refusing to eat cereal. I suppose convenience and time plays a big factor for us in our stressed, fast paced and rushed lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While time may be a factor most weekdays, weekend breakfasts are meant to be leisurely and the later the better. That’s when I like taking my time and make a good egg fry up for the family with some pressed beef, mushrooms, tomatoes, spicy sausages and maybe some lovely baked beans. Then there is the toast; sometimes it is a commercial white loaf and other times a lovely crisp rye bread or a home-baked loaf. It has to be toasted to perfection, crisp but still retaining some of its softness &#8211; served with lashings of cold butter. For drinks, there is freshly squeezed orange juice and plunged coffee for the adults. I also lay some lovely fruit on a platter, served with luscious and creamy Greek yoghurt and if I manage to get up early enough, some lovely fresh muffins, crispy sweet French toast or even doughnuts.  Feeling relaxed. Eating something that is a little bit more special than your average run of the mill weekday breakfast. Putting a little bit more effort into the aesthetics of the meal. Bottomless coffee. Perhaps flowers on the table.  Being totally present in that moment, enjoying your food, not thinking too much about the worries of the day, not concerning yourself with your to-do list, phone and other technological devices off to the side. Breakfast time is always social. And let me tell you something, if you&#8217;ve had a really hard day and have come home wondering what you are going to cook, breakfast for dinner is an idea. What’s wrong with spreading the breakfast mood to the rest of the day?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0606;"><strong>Perfect French toast</strong></span><br />
<em>I am not sure if the French actually invented French toast but I am really glad Martha Stewart perfected it.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0606;"><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></span><br />
• 6 large eggs<br />
• 1 ½ cups milk<br />
• Juice of 1 medium orange (about 1/4 cup)<br />
• Seeds of one vanilla pod<br />
• 1 tbsp sugar<br />
• Zest of 1 lemon (about 1 tbsp)<br />
• ½ tsp ground cinnamon<br />
• Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg<br />
• Pinch of salt<br />
• 6 slices of bread such as brioche, sliced 1-inch thick, preferably a day old<br />
• 4 tbsp unsalted butter<br />
• 4 tbsp vegetable oil (I use coconut oil)<br />
• Pure maple syrup (optional)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #bf0606;"> <em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. Whisk together eggs, milk, juice, vanilla, sugar, zest, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a bowl; set aside.<br />
2. Place bread in a shallow baking dish large enough to hold bread slices in a single layer. Pour egg mixture over the bread; soak for 10 minutes. Turn slices over; soak 10 minutes more or until soaked through.<br />
3. Preheat oven to 200°C. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet and set aside.<br />
4. Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry half the bread slices until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.<br />
5. Transfer to wire rack; place along with baking sheet in oven while cooking remaining bread.<br />
6. Wipe skillet and repeat with remaining butter, oil and bread. Keep in oven until ready to serve.<br />
7. Serve warm with maple syrup, if desired.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Add a little elegance to your fruit salad with this colourful fruit salad from Fatima Bheekoo-Shah.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years ago when I first trawled the Internet for recipes, I made a few friends on a site called Recipezaar. It was a place where you exchanged recipes and ideas and best of all, you made friends with foodies around the world. Through Recipezaar, I met a lady who called herself Zuri and was the author of a book that explored her childhood memories about food. Brought up on a farm outside of Stellenbosch, South Africa, Zuri soon left the beautiful farmlands for the city and was privileged to dine at some of the best restaurants in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zuri often said she judged the standard of a restaurant by the fruit salad on the menu. According to her, fruit salad is meant to be a blend of soft fruits &#8211; not hard, chewy ones &#8211; and they should be bite-sized and lay in a simple light sugar syrup &#8211; not be drowning in fruit juice. This has stuck with me when I make my own fruit salad. This recipe is simple and pairs well with thick, luscious Greek yoghurt. It is a firm favourite with the children in my home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc3000;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
<em>Fruit</em><br />
• 450 grams fresh strawberries, diced<br />
• 450 grams fresh pineapple, diced<br />
• 350 grams fresh blueberries<br />
• 350 grams red grapes, diced into halves<br />
• 4 kiwis, peeled and diced<br />
• 400 gram can mandarin oranges in juice, drained well and sliced into halves<br />
• 2 ripe bananas, diced</p>
<p><em>Honey Lime Dressing</em><br />
• ¼ cup honey (I use less as I am not fond of an overly sweet fruit salad)<br />
• 2 teaspoons lime zest (zest of 2 medium limes)<br />
• 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc3000;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. Add all fruit to a large mixing bowl<br />
2. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the honey, lime zest and lime juice<br />
3. Pour over fruit just before serving and toss to evenly coat. As it sits for a few minutes, the juices will gather at the bottom, so toss again before plating<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Notes:</em><br />
Instead of lime use the zest of oranges and a few drops of orange juice or orange blossom water for a Moroccan twist.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[While visiting friends and family in Ramadhan and beyond, your child’s social manners will impact on your social life and on the]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visiting a friend or even a relative with your kids in tow can often be a trying experience instead of the enjoyable occasion it is meant to be. Kids often get very excited when they find out they are going to a new place or visiting someone that they deeply love. Their emotions can get the upper hand and make them throw all caution, and unfortunately manners, to the wind. It’s up to parents to make their kids understand that while they can be happy about going on a visit, they must also exercise the best manners, especially if they want to be invited back in the future. Parents must also equip their children with the proper tools to succeed in being a good guest. Setting your own example of how to behave properly, whether in someone’s home or in public, is the fastest way to show your kids how to behave. Children are visual creatures and can benefit from seeing good manners first hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #33cccc;"> <strong>Manners Are Taught</strong></span><br />
Children can also be taught how to behave starting from the moment they understand what you are saying. “If we teach them manners from a young age we can instill in them the best behaviour in our homes as well as when visiting another home. We want happy, yet well behaved little Muslims as they are the future leaders of the Ummah,” shares Sister Zawajatul Moinuddin, who is a mother residing in Georgia, USA. Think of your child as an empty palette; as you teach them a new manner of behaving, a ‘colour’ is added to their repertoire of good behaviour. Before you know it, your child will have a whole rainbow of good manners to draw from no matter what circumstance arises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Communication Counts</strong></span><br />
Remember communication is key when teaching your kids about manners. Tell your children why they should behave properly. “I always explain to my kids that we are representatives of Islam and that we have to behave so people will get a good idea of our religion. I also remind them about the ‘recording angels’ on our right and left who record our good and bad deeds. I tell them we want the angels to always record the good deeds,” says Sister Zawajatul Moinuddin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Children can be taught simple manners when visiting guests based on their age group:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><em><strong>Toddlers</strong></em></span><br />
•      Wash their hands before and after the meal;<br />
•      Snack on some dried cereal that you brought for him while waiting for refreshments to be served.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong><em>Ages 5-9</em></strong></span><br />
•      Say “Assalamu Alaikum” when entering the home;<br />
•      Say ‘Please’ and “Jazakallah khayr”;<br />
•      Sit still when adults are talking and not interrupt without saying “Excuse Me” first;<br />
•      Play quietly with some toys they’ve brought from home;<br />
•      Help clear dishes and tidy up;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #33cccc;"><em><strong>Ages 10 –Teens</strong></em></span><br />
•      Greet adults properly and carry on a conversation about school or friends if asked;<br />
•      Ask permission before touching anything in the home like the computer or video games;<br />
•      Don’t open up drawers, cupboards or enter rooms without permission;<br />
•      Help prepare refreshments like filling glasses for the host or helping to set the table;<br />
•      Assist their mother with smaller siblings;<br />
•      Play cooperatively with other children without bickering or getting rowdy;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Cease and Desist </strong></span><br />
There will be times when your children will misbehave. It’s inevitable as they might react to factors beyond their control like someone bullying them or if they get hurt while visiting. In this event, you should have an established code word that you can say to your child so that he knows that while you understand he is upset, he still needs to keep a hold on his manners for the sake of the hosts. The code word should be something that you agree upon prior to any visit and one that you will both remember. For example, suppose your code word is ‘bunny’. When you feel that a situation is getting out of hand while visiting, gently pull your child aside and whisper the code word in his ear. Insha Allah he will be able to calm down and discuss the issue with you later out of view of your friends or family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>When All Else Fails</strong></span><br />
When a situation arises and your child simply cannot be coaxed into settling down, turn to your hostess for advice. There is nothing to be embarrassed about as all mothers have had their share of temper tantrums and embarassments at different stages of their child’s development.  “All of my friends and I are on the same page that we cannot let a child who is misbehaving continue to do so. I sometimes tell my friends’ kids to settle down and straighten up and they do the same with mine. At the end of the day, we are responsible for how our children behave. If we let them run wild they will continue to do so and will never learn from this kind of behaviour,” summates Sister Zawajatul Moinuddin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Visiting a friend or relative is a wonderful way to escape the routine you live day in and day out and, at times of celebration like Ramadhan, they are especially important. As far as possible, such visits should be free from stress and give you an opportunity to have a social experience with another adult from with which you both can benefit. Kids can profit also by using the experience as a learning tool to see the proper way to behave in a social setting. Teaching your children how to behave when visiting a guest will be an important life skill that will carry them well into adulthood and they will always remember that their mother was the one who taught them good manners.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[After a month of sincere and abundant worshipping during Ramadhan, Najma Mohamed encourages us to keep up the pace throughout the ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ramadhan ushers in a suite of blessings, restoring balance and harmony in our lives. Days and nights revolve around the rhythm of prayers. Hearts and hands are extended in giving. And families, neighbours, and communities gather in the spirit of love, care, and concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we ‘race in competing to do good deeds’, how can we ensure that this blessed month sets the standard and becomes the pattern on which we live the rest of our lives? In this article I will focus on three principles which, if lived by, will have an indelible impact, not only upon our own lives, but that that of our world: generosity, simple living, and being sociable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0080;"><strong>Lighten your pocket and give sadaqah</strong></span><br />
Sadaqah (voluntary charity) is often increased in the month of Ramadhan. It is reported that Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was “&#8230;naturally the most generous of people and he used to be more generous than ever in the month of Ramadan” <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Sahih Bukhari)</em></span>. Every man and woman who is able to must give Sadaqatul-Fitr, a special charity, preferably given in food, to the poor at the end of Ramadhan. It plays a pivotal role in purifying the month of fasting, and endeavours to ensure that everyone has enough to eat on the day of ‘Eid ul-Fitr.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from this special instruction, many Muslims, imbued with the heightened spiritual awareness of this month, increase their voluntary charity. International relief organisations, community food networks, and social welfare initiatives, such as orphanages and retirement homes are flooded by the outpour of generosity in the month of Ramadhan, alhamdulillah. However, many organisations raise the concern that their battles &#8211; to feed and clothe the needy; to maintain mosques, schools and clinics; and to build and strengthen livelihoods &#8211; continue after Ramadhan and that support is required throughout the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How then can we uphold this spirit of generosity? In Ramadhan, we often become more aware of those in need, both in our local area as well as in the wider community. While it is not always easy to maintain this awareness, select a project this month &#8211; an institution or a needy family &#8211; and make the intention to support this initiative throughout the year. Also take note of the wisdom in the Prophet Muhammad’s (SAW) words: “The most beloved actions to Allah are those performed consistently, even if they are few”<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Sahih Bukhari)</em></span> and “Wealth is not diminished by Sadaqah”<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Tirmidhi).</em></span> Be sincere and consistent in giving and remember, you may be lightening your pocket, but you’re adding to your bank balance in the akhirah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0080;"><strong>Tread lightly on the earth</strong></span><br />
Prophet Muhammad’s (SAW) life exemplifies the Qur’anic verse which speaks about the servants of Allah (SWT) as “the the ones who walk upon the earth softly…”<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Al Furqan:63)</em></span>. While towards the latter years of his life the Prophet (SAW) had attained a position where “he had the treasures of the world at his feet,” he chose simplicity: in his food, dress and living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Ramadhan provides an opportunity for us to assess our lifestyles, and to look at the ways in which we are discharging the trust which we have undertaken. Are we, as khalifatullaah fil ardh (trustees of Allah (SWT) on earth), living lightly? We can use this month of reflection to look at our ecological footprint, the demand which we are placing on the earth’s natural resources, and endeavour to lighten our impact on the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LiveGreen columnist, Arwa Aburawa, explored food wastage in our Ramadhan issue,  suggesting ways to cut down on this waste in this blessed month. There are several guidelines available to help us assess and reduce our impact on the earth’s resources and get us going on the path to more sustainable living, including the <em>Muslim Green Guide to Reducing Climate Change</em> (Lifemakers UK and Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences); <em>Green Deen: What Islam Teaches About Protecting the Planet</em> (Ibrahim Abdul-Matin); and <em>199 Ways to Please God: How to (Re-)Align your Daily Life with your Duty of Care for Creation</em> (Rianne ten Veen). These resources provide practical suggestions of ways to put the environmental message of Islam into action in our lives, in Ramadhan and beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0080;"><strong>Straighten your heart</strong></span><br />
In standing shoulder to shoulder when we perform our prayers, in the meals we have shared for iftar and in the joyous celebrations of ‘Eid, we have blossomed in the warmth of humanity. These occasions for social interaction throughout the month of Ramadhan build and strengthen love and cooperation in the home, community and society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One mother commented that family meal times, usually a rarity, are a gift in her home during Ramadhan. With her heart full of love and gratitude for these precious moments, her family shares the pre-dawn suhoor and the evening meal at sunset, and for an entire month the family eats together. Another sister spoke of the opportunity of sharing a meal or dish with a neighbour and thereby coming to know the families in one’s neighbourhood. And one young student remembers the sweet moments of taking her iftar with the poor and needy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The importance of kindness and consideration towards families, neighbours, the poor and the destitute, fellow Muslims, and indeed all of creation is heightened in this month. Ramadhan gives us the chance to love and care for humanity and remove the prejudice and intolerance which is dividing our world. It straightens our hearts and reminds us that verily, in the sight of Allah (SWT), the best of us are the muttaqoon, those who are conscious of Allah (SWT), who strive to live by His commands and to avoid what He prohibits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0080;"><strong>Give, live simply, and love all Creation</strong></span><br />
The restorative properties of Ramadhan, like an oasis, revive the spirit and awaken the senses. Our hearts, bodies, and pockets, weighed down by an attachment and desire for the life of this world, is now lighter. Before we continue our journey, take hold of these blessings of Ramadhan to light the way ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we exerted ourselves to attain the sweetness of Allah’s (SWT) mercy, forgiveness and freedom from the fire in this month, what will we do to sustain this effort? As we held on to every second in this sacred month to cleanse our souls, improve our characters and purify our hearts and bodies, how will we ensure that we do not return to a state of neglect? As Ramadhan departs, let us strive to live all our days on the beautiful pattern which we tried to establish in this blessed month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘Eid Mubarak to all my wonderful sisters!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Eid-ul-Fitr gives us the opportunity to celebrate not only the blessings that the month of Ramadhan brought us, but it also reminds us of all the blessings Allah (SWT) bestows upon us throughout our lives. However, I wonder how long we manage to keep this feeling of celebration and gratitude after ‘Eid has passed. Often, our normal routine takes over and we lose the specialness of the days and moments just gone. The month of Ramadhan has a unique, celebratory quality to it, but once it passes, so does our sense of daily celebration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a moment to think about your daily routine. Do you get caught up in the busyness? Are you often stressed out, or find yourself complaining about things just because you’re tired? Perhaps your friends keep telling you to take some time out for yourself. Do you take their advice? Many sisters don’t usually take much time out, or they feel guilty if they do. Take sister Farzana’s example. She has five kids and is a devoted mother. However, when she came to coaching, she had very little energy left to give to her children. She looked tired and run down, had put on a lot of weight and was feeling quite depressed overall. After digging a bit deeper, I discovered that she never took any time out, even though she had the option of help available. She was feeling quite negative and resentful about her life. Her life, to her, felt like a big chore, with nothing to celebrate. She hadn’t had any time off in years. After some exploration, she realised that she was left guilt-ridden by a comment that someone had made when she was a new mum. They had suggested that a mum who takes any time out is a bad mother. Farzana had taken this comment to heart and hardly ever left her children because she felt they were her responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you find yourself responsible for a demanding job, in-laws, or perhaps children? Maybe you are so busy that you don’t take any time to just be, or enjoy life. For many of us, life is now about getting the job done, and taking time to smell the roses just doesn’t feel like an option. Reflect on your own situation for a moment. How are you feeling at the end of the day? Is tiredness pretty much a constant state? Look even deeper for a moment. How fulfilled are you feeling? Does life hold any joy or a sense of wonder about it? I imagine not. When we are busy running and doing, life has little wonder or enjoyment left. So how do we get out of this situation? We need to do two things. The first is to take time to rest, but that is not the subject of our discussion. The second, sometimes more challenging, is to incorporate a little bit of celebration into our everyday life. Let’s look at why celebration is important, and lets explore a few tips on how to add a sense of celebration into our everyday lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Celebration is an attitude of gratitude!</strong></span><br />
Celebration is often thought of as something to “do” when an occasion arises. Of course, occasions give us a wonderful reason to take time out, to be with friends and family, and to just give ourselves a bit of a break from the routine. However, celebration is not something we do, but rather an attitude we adopt that then becomes a way of being. Being appreciative of life comes through in our actions, and then celebration becomes the way in which we live life. Think of someone you know who is truly appreciative of life and the blessings that Allah (SWT) has bestowed upon him or her. How does this attitude show in their behaviour? I imagine that they are optimistic and feel pretty healthy most of the time, not to mention the fact that they probably get things done. This is because celebrating life motivates us to make the most of it. Celebration doesn’t have to be something that takes a lot of effort, it can just be taking a stroll in the park and appreciating the flowers, looking at the stars, or just enjoying the warmth of a cup of tea. Taking these little moments to appreciate life provides a real ‘break’ from it all and motivates us to act when we get going again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Give guilt the ‘heave-ho’</strong></span><br />
Feeling guilty will instantly ruin any sort of celebration. Guilt often comes about when we feel we ‘shouldn’t’ be taking a break, or don’t really deserve one. The purpose of the guilt is to keep us motivated towards doing things, but it accomplishes quite the opposite. Guilt keeps us in the cycle of the ‘doing’ but it doesn’t add to the quality of what we are doing. We still remain tired, and perhaps other negative emotions such as anger, or blame get in the way. Think about the last time that you felt guilty about taking a break, or doing something just to enjoy the moment. What happened? Did you do what you wanted to do? And if so, how did it feel? And if you kept on with what you should have been doing, how did that feel? I imagine that whichever way you went, the feeling was equally unpleasant. The only way to truly feel motivated is to explore the true reason for why you want to do what you’re doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions:<br />
• Why am I doing these things? What does doing them give me?<br />
• What is causing me to feel guilty when I decide to take a break?<br />
• How might I take a real break to enjoy the moment, and be there to do what I need to get done?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Write a daily Gratitude List</strong></span><br />
Nothing saps our energy like having a lot to do, but having nothing to look forward to. The first thing we need to do here is to begin to appreciate what we already have before we can feel enthusiastic about what’s to come. At the end of every day, take 5 minutes to write down all the things that you feel grateful for at that moment. They could be small things that happened during the day, such as getting to work on time, or having a nice phone conversation, to something of significance like passing an exam. Some days will only bring one thing, while others will have more. With practice, you will begin to notice that the glass is not only half full, but that you truly have a lot to appreciate. The next step is to write down one or two ways in which you can regularly celebrate life. Perhaps it is taking a walk in the park 3 times a week, or having a weekly coffee with a friend. You will notice yourself appreciating life even more as you continue to implement them into your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Just stop for a moment</strong></span><br />
It is essential to stop and savour the moment; that is what celebration and enjoying life is all about. You may well have lots to do, but stopping for a while may make you even more productive than you already are. Choose a time of day when you will be able to take a few minutes out without someone demanding your attention. Close your eyes and take a deep breath through your nose, breathing into your diaphragm and releasing each breath slowly through your mouth. Allow your attention to flow inwards and notice what it is that you need and promise yourself to honour this need. These few moments of slowing down will enhance productivity when you’re busy doing things. Remember, first be, then do, then have the results you want!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insha Allah, celebration will help us all attain further closeness to Allah (SWT) as well as motivate us to live a more energetic and purposeful life. I hope that these tips will get you well on your way. Soon you will notice lots of reasons to celebrate the life you have, insha Allah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Muslims have an ongoing love affair with date fruits. Whether it's Ramadhan or not, dates are never out of season. Learn and enjoy]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dates are the precious jewels of the Muslim Ummah. They are most prominent in the month of Ramadhan, when the iftar is opened with an odd number of dates and water, following the sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (SAW). Dates are, however, not forgotten in the other months. In Arabian culture, it is customary to greet guests with a platter of fresh dates and qahwa. They are also the first food to touch a newborn’s mouth when, in the Prophetic tradition of tahneek, a softened date is rubbed on the palate of the newborn soon after birth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many recipes call for chopped dates as a sweetener, but sometimes the sweetness doesn’t evenly distribute in the final product. Also, some people don’t like the taste of chopped fruit in their mouth &#8211; and most people don’t want to spend ages chopping sticky fruits and getting their hands dirty! That’s when raw, homemade date paste comes in handy. Date paste is a natural fruit sweetener, giving cakes a moist texture and making them extremely flavourful. Date paste can be used in a multitude of recipes, such as over pancakes in place of maple syrup, and is especially tasty in milkshakes or mixed with hot milk during the cold months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Storage: It’s a good idea to make date paste in bulk to have at hand when you need it. It will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months. You can store it in an airtight plastic container and break off chunks when you need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Date Paste</span></strong><br />
This recipe yields 2 cups of date paste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #993300;">Ingredients</span></em></strong><br />
• 40 good quality dates<br />
• Warm water for soaking<br />
• 2 tbsp filtered water</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. Soak dates in warm water until tender.<br />
2. Remove from water and remove all stones by hand.<br />
3. Combine all the dates and 2 tbsp water in food processor. Puree.<br />
4. Stop the food processor at intervals and scrape down the sides.<br />
5. Puree until thick and creamy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Tip: you can add a squeeze of lemon juice instead of water for a tangy sweetener. Or try adding a vanilla bean to your date paste before processing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Sweet Date Biscuits</strong></span><br />
‘Meethi tikya’ are biscuits found in Pakistani cuisine, literally translating into ‘sweet flat cakes’. Housewives usually make them in Ramadhan for iftar and also in the other months to serve at tea time. I have combined the recipe for meethi tikya with ma’moul, a shortbread pastry found in the Gulf countries. It’s best to make a big batch – these fragrant cookies don’t last long!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
½ cup date paste<br />
1 tsp cinnamon powder<br />
2 cups plain/all purpose flour<br />
1 egg<br />
2 tbsp fine semolina powder<br />
¾ tsp baking powder<br />
1-2 tbsp desiccated coconut<br />
8 tbsp sugar<br />
½ tsp cardamom powder<br />
½ tsp salt<br />
2 tbsp fine milk powder, such as NIDO<br />
1 tsp vanilla essence OR 1 tsp orange blossom water (optional)<br />
2 tbsp ghee</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #993300;">Method</span></em></strong><br />
1. Mix date paste with cinnamon powder in separate bowl.<br />
2. Pour oil into a small pot for deep frying; leave on low heat to heat up.<br />
3. Mix rest of the ingredients together by hand to form a dough. If the dough is too dry and not coming together, add whole milk 1 tsp at a time until it comes together.<br />
4. Rub a little ghee on your hands. Make balls a little smaller than a golf ball and flatten into disc shape. Put a little bit of date mixture in the middle. Join with another disc and flatten with your palm. Lay the discs on a plate.<br />
5. When all the dough has been used up, deep fry the biscuits on low to medium heat. The biscuits will float up if the oil is the correct temperature.<br />
6. When golden brown, remove from oil with a slotted spoon and lay on a paper towel. When cooled, put biscuits in a container with a lid. Add 2 tbsp powdered sugar in the container, close the lid and shake to coat all biscuits.<br />
7. Take a bite!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Decadent Date and Chocolate Cake with Sticky Toffee Glaze</strong></span><br />
As with all cakes, this cake is even tastier the next day. The date paste contributes to its moist texture while the glaze sets to create a satiny finish. The glaze is so tasty and beautiful to look at that it’s now my go-to glaze for all cakes. Present it with a flourish at your next dinner and the ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’ will make it worth the effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>The Cake</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
• 1 cup date paste<br />
• 1¼ cup hot coffee<br />
• ¾ cup butter<br />
• ½ cup white sugar<br />
• ¼ cup brown sugar<br />
• 2 large eggs, room temperature<br />
• 1 tsp vanilla essence<br />
• 1 cup flour<br />
• ½ cup cocoa powder<br />
• 1 tsp baking soda<br />
• ½ tsp salt<br />
• 1 tsp cinnamon powder<br />
• Juice and zest of 1 orange<br />
• ½ cup good quality chocolate, roughly chopped</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><em>Method</em></strong></span><br />
1. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.<br />
2. Grease a 22.5cm cake tin with butter. Put the tin on baking parchment and, with a pencil, mark a circle on the parchment. Cut and insert parchment in pan. Butter the paper.<br />
3. Cover date paste with hot coffee and leave to soak.<br />
4. With a mixer, beat butter and brown and white sugar in bowl for 2 minutes. Add eggs one at a time and beat. Add vanilla and beat.<br />
5. Place a fine sieve over the bowl. Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon powder into the bowl. Mix well.<br />
6. Puree coffee and date paste in blender. Pour in batter. Add orange juice and zest, mix well. Fold in chopped chocolate.<br />
7. Pour in prepared pan. Bake for 55–60 minutes until edges begin to pull away and cake is done. Cool in pan for 5 minutes. Turn out onto serving plate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>The Sticky Toffee Glaze </strong></span><br />
The brown sugar in the glaze provides a caramel flavour. If you’re not a fan of caramel, substitute the brown sugar with white sugar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
• 3½ tbsp butter<br />
• ¼ cup dark brown sugar<br />
• 1 tbsp water<br />
• Pinch salt<br />
• 1⁄3 cup cream<br />
• ½ cup chocolate pieces</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #993300;">Method</span></em></strong><br />
1. Add butter, sugar, water and salt to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and continue boiling for 2-3 minutes.<br />
2. Remove from heat. Whisk in cream, then chocolate. Let cool until thickened.<br />
3. Pour over cake, letting the silky glaze drip down the sides. It will set almost immediately.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Kanika Aggarwal takes us through the sunnah of being both a host and a guest in preparation for the blessed days of ‘Eid.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The end of Ramadhan is a time for celebration. We celebrate our hard work, sacrifices and efforts that we put into various acts of ‘ibadah (devotion) during Ramadhan, for the sake of Allah (SWT). The onset of &#8216;Eid brings about many opportunities to host parties and get-togethers with friends and family to enjoy the festivities. While indulging in merry-making, there are many acts of sunnah (the way of the Prophet (SAW) that we can follow to increase our reward and make our gatherings blessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First and foremost, realise that being hospitable to guests is following the way of the prophets of Allah (SWT), as can be seen by the example of Ibrahim (AS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:<br />
<span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong>&#8220;Has the story reached you, of the honoured guests [three angels; Jibril (Gabriel) along with another two] of Ibrahim (Abraham)? When they came in to him and said: &#8216;Salam (peace be upon you),&#8217; He answered: &#8216;Salam (peace be upon you),&#8217; and said: &#8216;You are a people unknown to me.&#8217; Then he turned to his household, and brought out a roasted calf [as the property of Ibrahim (Abraham) was mainly cows]. And placed it before them, (saying): &#8216;Will you not eat?&#8221;&#8216; </strong></em></span><br />
<em><span style="color: #999999;">(Adh-Dhariyat: 24-27)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The following hadith of the Prophet (SAW) serves as further encouragement for true Muslims who are believers in Allah (SWT) and the last day, to be hospitable and welcoming towards their guests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever believes in Allah and the last day, let him honour his guest.&#8221; <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Bukhari and Muslim)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The duties of the person who is hosting a gathering include welcoming the guest, taking care of their comfort and ease, and treating them in a nice manner according to their own capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listed below are some general etiquettes for the host and the guests to make the gatherings blessed by following the sunnah of the Prophet (SAW):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>GUIDANCE FOR THE HOST</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>The virtue of offering food</strong></span><br />
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Salaam (RA) said that the Prophet (SAW) said: “O people, spread salam, give food and pray when the people are sleeping; you will enter Paradise in peace and safety.”<em><span style="color: #999999;"> (Tirmidhi)</span></em><br />
Thus, offering food to guests is highly encouraged in Islam, because not only is it considered a sign of generosity, it is also pleasing to Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Do not be stingy with the quantity of food</strong></span><br />
Abu Hurayrah (RA) reported that the Prophet (SAW) said, &#8220;The food of two persons suffices for three persons, and the food of three persons suffices for four persons.&#8221; <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Bukhari and Muslim)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The host should not be miserly and worry about his resources depleting because of guests. Rather, he should be generous because of the words of the Prophet (SAW) which indicate that when people share food at a gathering, Allah (SWT) places barakah (an increase) in the quantity and it can suffice everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Extend a handshake when your guests arrive</strong></span><br />
Al-Bara&#8217; (RA) reported that the Prophet (SAW) said, &#8220;Two Muslims will not meet and shake hands without having their sins forgiven (by Allah) before they depart.&#8221; <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Abu Dawud)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
This hadith indicates that Allah forgives the (minor) sins of the two believers who shake hands upon meeting. This should be practiced by the host when the guests arrive. This will benefit both the host and the guest by increasing the mutual love for each other and attaining forgiveness for minor sins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Encourage guests to eat more but do not push them</strong></span><br />
It is reported in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (RA) in the book of Bukhari, that the Prophet (SAW) asked him repeatedly to drink milk, by saying, “Drink,” until he (Abu Hurayrah) said, “By the One Who sent you with the truth, I have no more room for it!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We can learn that once the guest stops eating, the host should encourage him to eat more, but scholars suggest that he should not repeat it more than three times to avoid pushing the guest to eat more and cause discomfort to himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>GUIDANCE FOR THE GUEST</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Initiate Salam when you arrive at the host&#8217;s house</strong></span><br />
Abu Hurayrah (RA) reported: the Prophet (SAW) said, &#8220;When one of you arrives in a gathering, he should offer Salam to those who are already there, and he should also do so when he intends to depart. The first act of greeting is not more meritorious than the last.&#8221; <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Abu Dawud)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
This hadith encourages the guest to offer Salam to the host and those present at the gathering, at the time of arrival and departure. Gestures such as saying “Asalaamu ‘alaikum” and hand-shaking break the ice and set a great atmosphere for an Islamic gathering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Make du’a for the host</strong></span><br />
The sunnah of the Prophet (SAW) teaches us that the guest should make a du’a (supplication) for the host, his well-being and for an increase in his sustenance, as a token of thanks for his hospitality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The du’a is as follows: <strong><em><span style="color: #333399;">Allaahumma baarik lahum feemaa razaqtahum, waghfir lahum warhamhum.</span></em></strong> (O Allah, bless them in what You have provided for them, and forgive them and have mercy on them.) <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Muslim)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Following these prophetic practices will not only increase the host and the guests in love for each other for the sake of Allah (SWT) and His Deen, it will also cause the gatherings to be more Islamically prosperous and beneficial for everyone involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, go ahead and enjoy your &#8216;Eid! May Allah (SWT) allow us all to come closer to Him, and each other, for His sake through these gatherings, ameen!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Getting a puzzled look when you mention Eid? Rana Bacaloni shares some simple ways to spread the joy of the Islamic holiday.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever feel like you live a double life during Ramadhan and &#8216;Eid? If you are like me and have children, you turn the house into a laboriously decorated affair, where no nook or cranny is left untouched. I have seen the joy in my kids’ eyes as they witness their kingdom magically transformed into Candyland and I feel fulfilled, until they step outside and want to share that joy with their friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often times my children are asked by their friends, “Why are you so dressed up today?” or “How come you didn’t come to school yesterday?” and I can imagine their eyes open wide with excitement as they relive the magic of &#8216;Eid, eager to share the love for the day with their friends. But, more often than not, the blank looks on their friends’ faces may lead them to the inevitable conclusion that their friends have no clue about this beautiful holiday they love so much. Attempting to communicate even just the pronunciation of the word “&#8217;Eid” can be a monumental struggle, and many times my own and other Muslim children may just give up trying to explain, turning &#8216;Eid from a day of blessings and joy into something awkward that they don’t feel comfortable talking about. If you have witnessed these exchanges between children like I have, then maybe you have similarly felt the carefully crafted and decorated &#8216;Eid paradise at home crumble beneath you, and you end up wishing &#8216;Eid could be a holiday like Christmas, where everyone knows about it, talks about it, lives it, and internalizes it. Even Hanukkah, a holiday virtually as unknown as &#8216;Eid not so many years ago, is now up on the same pedestal as Christmas, and menorah lighting has become commonplace in big cities all over the world. For entire months before the Holiday in question, our lives are filled with storefronts, school activities and street décor, all dedicated to making sure that no one can possibly forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have always wondered: <i>Why couldn’t &#8216;Eid be that special?</i> This is the question I had in mind when trying to make &#8216;Eid as special for my children as Christmas and Hanukkah are for other children and the question that eventually led me to create my company, &#8216;Eid Creations. It was surprising to see that there was little available in terms of decorations for &#8216;Eid, and I tried to make do with what I had and fashion my own decorations. But once I joined the board of my children’s Islamic school and was in charge of events and fundraising, I quickly realized this was not only a problem for me. Finding quality decorations or any decorations for &#8216;Eid was a problem that most Muslims faced. &#8216;Eid doesn’t come with universally recognized symbols like a Christmas tree to decorate or a Menorah to light up, so it was ultimately challenging for me to create designs that would engage our larger communities about &#8216;Eid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an attempt to enrich pluralistic societies with various ethnic cultures and become part of its fabric, petitions have been signed in big numbers to make &#8216;Eid a national holiday. The outcome in the United States and the United Kingdom, where large Muslim communities strive, has not yet been positive; New York being an exception, where &#8216;Eid holiday was recognized as recently as 2015. It will take some time for societies to fully embrace differences, when they realize that integration is the best way to achieve harmony, but we should not lose hope, as the struggle for integration is a déjà vu phenomenon that every new community is faced with at one point in time. This year, we can create that dialogue and put an end to this double life that I and so many other Muslims feel we live, by participating in an &#8216;Eid awareness campaign called #giveEid where we share the joys of &#8216;Eid with our neighbors, co-workers, teachers, and friends by giving them either homemade or store bought sweets and starting a discourse about a day that means so much to us and to our children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us already have a tradition of baking cookies with our children and sharing them with our family and friends after prayers, so why not expand that generosity, so common for Muslims, to our neighbours and peers? Participating in the campaign is as easy and it can be a fun activity for you especially if you have children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Eid Creations will be giving out prizes for best recipes, best packaging, best photos and best greetings. To enter for a chance to win, simply follow @eidcreations on Instagram and submit a photo relating to your gift. The picture can be anything, from a selfie with the sweets, to a photo of a recipe or even the packaging. The sky is the limit when it comes to all the possibilities! And don’t forget to hash tag #giveEid to see all the amazing submissions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by Martin Luther King, I say the following words: “I have a dream that a day will come when Muslims will contribute  positive changes in the communities they live in as they did in the past. I have a dream that &#8216;Eid will be part of the public culture. I have a dream where Muslims will no longer have to live a double life.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[J. Samia Mair shares her holiday-season experiences and talks to other sisters living in non-Muslim countries about their ‘Eid c]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Old habits truly do die hard. Each year I find myself singing along with the endless stream of Christmas carols played in malls during the holiday season. I can only imagine what the other shoppers think of  this off-key, middle-aged hijabi , who knows the lyrics to <em>Silent Night, The Little Drummer Boy</em>, and <em>Jingle Bells</em> by heart. In my defence, even the most cautious American converts find it difficult to escape the long tentacles of the Christmas season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christmas falls on December 25th in the United States and commemorates the birth of ‘Isa (AS). Foremost among the traditions is the giving of gifts. When I was young, advertising for Christmas began after Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November). Eventually, stores started advertising before Thanksgiving, and now Christmas displays are up by Halloween at the end of October. There is even “Christmas in July” to encourage more shopping.  Unmercifully, Christmas shopping does not end on December 25th. There are the “after-Christmas sales”, which run right up to New Year’s Day or longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christmas is arguably the most important American holiday but that, is by no means it. Moving along the Gregorian calendar, one encounters: New Year’s Day, Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Easter, Mother’s Day, Memorial Day, Father’s Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas &#8211; and this list is not complete. Finding the social space to celebrate the Islamic holidays in a country with a lot of holiday background noise requires some effort. The vast majority of Americans know nothing about the Islamic holidays. The month of Ramadhan and the ‘Eids are just ordinary days. Everyone eats, works, and attends school as normal. Muslims must work around this lack of knowledge. For example, many Muslims attend the earliest ‘Eid prayers if unable to take time off from work or school. Similarly, ‘Eid celebrations may have to wait until the weekend if ‘Eid falls on a weekday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I asked some sisters, converts and others, whose relatives live overseas, to tell me how they celebrate the Islamic holidays here. Some common themes emerged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Loneliness</strong></span><br />
Celebrating Islamic holidays in a non-Muslim country can be lonely. Muslim immigrants miss their families and friends.<br />
<em>It can be lonely sometimes especially when you celebrated it with your family and now you live in different countries. </em>(Nasreen)<br />
Converts may go from celebrating more than ten holidays during the year with their non-Muslim families and friends to celebrating none. Some avoid asking their relatives to celebrate with them, fearing that they will have to reciprocate:</p>
<p><em>…I believe that if I bring it up with my family to celebrate it with us, they would. The only thing is that if we want something from them, then they will be expecting something from us. Also, they will feel if they can celebrate our holiday then we should celebrate theirs or else they will resent us. Therefore, we just do our own thing. Of course, I will not deny that sometimes I do cry because I feel lonely, but then I remind myself that Allah (SWT) does not put any burden on you that you cannot handle. It is pretty lonely when you and your husband are the only Muslims. </em>(Anisah)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several sisters report that their non-Muslim parents do not give any ‘Eid gifts or cards to their children, while others report that their parents occasionally remember.</p>
<p><em>Sometimes [non-Muslim relatives] will say “Happy ‘Eid”, usually as part of another phone call… Yes, they give gifts sometimes. The time of receiving the gifts doesn’t always coincide with &#8216;Eid, although they are sometimes called &#8216;Eid gifts. </em>(Elizabeth).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Maintaining and establishing traditions</span></strong><br />
Many Muslim immigrants try to maintain the traditions of their birth country and transmit them to their children living here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Undoubtedly, it&#8217;s a challenge to keep the culture going, since we&#8217;re the only ones in the family living abroad, but we find ways to be as creative as possible to emulate the spirit and culture of celebrating both ‘Eids similar to the home country. It&#8217;s essential for our children to learn and experience the culture that their parents grew up in as part of acknowledging their identity and heritage.</em> (Suriati)<br />
It is not always easy to maintain traditions. Many Muslims remember sheep and goats roaming their neighbourhood in preparation for ‘Eid al-Adha. Some kept sheep in their bathroom and slaughtered them in their backyard. Laws in the United States, especially in urban areas, often restrict which animals can be kept and where they can be slaughtered. Performing the sacrifice oneself is not always easy here, which results in many Muslims paying for an organisation to do the slaughter and distribute the meat, thus foregoing the main ritual of the holiday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Converts face a different problem. They have no traditions and seek to establish their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>We&#8217;ve tried hard to establish our own rituals around ‘Eid and Ramadhan. My favourite memories of Christmas growing up, are the family traditions that we had and I know that&#8217;s what my kids need too. We have banners that we&#8217;ve sewn together and other decorations (both homemade and store bought) that we put up around the house. Insha Allah, I&#8217;m hoping that these small things that we do every year will build upon themselves.</em> (Laura)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>…I do my best to make ‘Eids really fun. I always bake crescent cookies so they are associated with the holiday. I usually put up blue and gold decorations (lights, stars, moons) … But, the big deal for ‘Eid in our house is the morning treasure hunt. I cut stars and moons out of blue paper and write silly rhyming clues. Each clue leads to a small gift with another clue attached.</em> (Tracey)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span style="color: #993300;">The surrogate family</span></strong><br />
Many converts and Muslim immigrants celebrate the Islamic holidays with a surrogate family, often comprised of others similarly situated.<br />
<em>For ‘Eid al-Fitr, we sometimes (when able by taking time off from work) go to the ‘Eid prayer and then go and have breakfast with some other families. We may visit their homes that day (again, if we’re off from work). With ‘Eid al-Adha, the husbands will usually slaughter a sheep, and then the women will sit together and maybe make some dishes with the meat or organs and then we will just eat some food and drink coffee or tea and just have a very nice day.</em> (Barbara)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Our friends are like family, so I don&#8217;t think my children are necessarily missing out on warm holiday memories because we socialise a lot during that time.</em> (Danette)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Creating new “familial” relationships is reminiscent of the Prophetic period. The Muhajireen left their families and everything they knew when they made the Hijra for the sake of Allah (SWT). Until they were more established in Madinah, the Prophet (SAW) paired each Muhajireen with an Ansar. The ummah fulfilled the role of family, and the same is true for many Muslims today. Anisa expresses what many of us feel:  Insha Allah, my daughters will have it better when they marry and have kids. At least they will have each other and whoever they marry will add to the family gathering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Building up a community and traditions takes time, but it will happen. Our children will have it easier as our numbers increase and more Islamic institutions are established.  And I doubt that my grandchildren will hear their hijab-wearing mothers humming Christmas carols in shopping malls &#8211; insha Allah!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;Eid is a time to rejoice and celebrate by wearing new clothes, attending the &#8216;Eid prayer and wishing each other “&#8217;Eid Mubarak”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;Eid is a sweet time for Muslims, quite literally! While numerous meat dishes are prepared for the main feast, there is no compromise when it comes to desserts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carrot halwa (some call it gajrela or carrot pudding) is one of the traditional Indian/Pakistani desserts that are prepared on the day of &#8216;Eid. The Arabic root Halwā literally means &#8220;sweet&#8221;. It is a sweet and creamy South Asian dish, made by boiling carrots with milk, sugar, fat, dry fruits, saffron and cardamom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dessert can be enjoyed warm (with milk/tea) or cold (with vanilla ice-cream).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Makes: 4 Portions</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
• 250g carrots<br />
• 120g sugar<br />
• 500ml milk<br />
• 50g ghee (clarified butter)<br />
• 30g dried raisins &amp; cashew nuts<br />
• A few cardamom pods<br />
• ¼ tsp saffron threads</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. Grate carrots and keep aside.</p>
<p>2. Heat up the milk and add grated carrots to the milk and cook.</p>
<p>3. When the milk dries up, add the ghee and fry.</p>
<p>4. Add sugar, cardamom pods, saffron threads and half the raisins and cashew nuts.</p>
<p>5. Mix well and cook for a few more minutes.</p>
<p>6. Fry the rest of the nuts.</p>
<p>7. Garnish with the fried cashew nuts and raisins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to wishing you a sweet and prosperous &#8216;Eid! May your life be filled with sweetness and the company of your loved ones, ameen!</p>

<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Aloo kay Samosay – Potato Stuffed Triangular Pastries</strong></span><br />
<em><strong>By Mona Hussain</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3711" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_255644479-1024x682.jpg" alt="shutterstock_255644479" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_255644479-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_255644479-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_255644479-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chai shops, bakeries, mithaiwala shops, cart vendors, chat bhandars along the length and breadth of the Indian subcontinent – all sell these magical pastries. Having travelled to India, possibly from the Middle East, Samosas are triangular pastries, a popular street food, usually stuffed with minced meat, or a potato mixture. They are the usual appetisers that make their presence at weddings, ‘Eid, iftar, or even a simple meal with the family! They are enjoyed throughout India and all over the world.</p>

<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>For Covering</em></span><br />
• 1 cup all-purpose flour/Maida<br />
• 1 cup whole wheat flour/durum flour<br />
• 1 tsp carom seeds<br />
• ½ tsp nigella seeds<br />
• 2 tbsp canola oil<br />
• Water<br />
• Salt to taste</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. Heat the oil in a saucepan. As soon as it warms up, add the cumin seeds, mustard seeds and ginger and let them splutter. After a few seconds, add the chopped potatoes and carrots. Add water to cover the vegetables and add red chilli powder, salt, cumin seed powder and the dried fenugreek leaves. Cover with a lid. As soon as the potatoes are done, uncover and add the frozen peas or cooked dried peas, garam masala, chopped coriander leaves and lemon juice. Cook while stirring until the mixture is dry. Keep aside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Now prepare the dough. Add the all-purpose flour, carom seeds, nigella seeds and salt in a mixing bowl and mix. Add canola oil and mix well using your fingers. Gradually add water, and knead to form a smooth and pliable dough. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead until elastic. Cover with a towel and keep aside for 30 minutes for the dough to rest. Later, shape the dough into 8 balls and cover them with a towel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. One by one roll the balls into thin ovals. Using a pizza cutter or a knife, cut each oval into two halves, thus a total of 16 half-ovals. Cover the rest with a towel while filling others. Take a half-oval and brush half of each straight edge with water, using your fingertip. Fold the second half of the straight edge over the first half to form a cone. Pinch to close the seam. Hold the cone with the open end up and fill the cone with some of the filling. Cut off any excess dough and use it later. Brush one side of the open end with water. Pinch to seal the top edges, enclosing the filling. Prepare all the samosas the same way, and keep them covered under a towel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Once all are ready, heat the oil in a deep saucepan. To test if the oil is ready to be used, drop a pinch of dough into the hot oil, the dough should come up within a few seconds. Deep fry the samosas a few at a time, until golden. Using a slotted spoon remove them into a strainer. Serve warm along with tamarind chutney or ketchup. Once cool, they can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days and reheated in the oven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong><em>To bake the samosa</em></strong></span><br />
After step 4, place the samosas in a greased or non-stick baking tray. Bake in a 220° C preheated oven for 20 minutes or until light brown in colour. Serve immediately</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[S. M. Jones shares her experience of seeking Laylatul-Qadr.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We often find tribulations along our path to salvation and happiness. Regardless of our strength, we have all known that period in time when death seemed closer than life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few years ago I found myself in that space in time. Month after month passed and I found myself praying harder each day just to make it to the next. Losing faith with every seemingly unanswered prayer. With every day that went by, my burdens seemed to be the same; I had reached a point where I was running out of fuel, fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the good news reached me, Ramadhan would soon be upon us. I remember begging Allah I to extend my life, and allow me to find hope in this blessed month. I was broken down and angry because I had expected from people what only my Lord could give. Getting through that Ramadhan was tough, but I could think of no better cure, no better blessing, than to ask and become purified in such a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sought a night within it, that night during which Allah (SWT) said He revealed His Holy book, The Night of Decree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I, like many Muslims, had read a thousand times that on this blessed night, better than a thousand months, angels descended and tranquility was realised until dawn. I had read it all before, and sought it many Ramadhans in the past, but this year my Lord would have mercy on me, and grant me relief right before my fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the last ten days arrived. I can remember it clearly: every night, even and odd, I would stay up the entirety of the night. I was broken, but I was sure if I didn’t pull myself together in this month, my soul might die completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was the seventh night of the last ten days, and I could remember feeling the adrenaline rush through my body. I stood up, faced the Qiblah, and I prayed. I asked Allah (SWT) to increase my faith, to accept my supplications and to make me content. Of course no one can be sure, but I prayed that night as if I had found Laylatul-Qadr, and I prayed harder than I had ever prayed and asked more sincerely than I had ever asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recalled the words of the Most Gracious: “Therein descend angels and the Ruh by their Lord’s permission with every matter. There is peace until the appearance of dawn.’’<em> (Al Qadr:4-5)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember becoming so overwhelmed and involved with what I sought that soon I had forgotten my burdens, forgotten my troubles, and only felt nearness and contentment. My standing and my prostration became a thing of ease, an action of grace. I had started out seeking relief from my burdens, but ended up in pure tranquility. I asked Allah (SWT) to have the angels present, be hosts of glad tidings for me, and to say ‘Ameen’ to that which I asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before long, the adhan of Fajr was being announced. The sun rose that day with no strong rays, and was easy to see with the eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) knows best if I found it, but I learned a greater lesson that night. Allah (SWT) reminded me how to seek aid, how to be humble, how to have hope, and restored my forbearance. Though I may not be able to control the decree, I can always ask The One who can, because He hears me.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hafsah Zamir shares her tips for achieving that beautiful henna pattern, and how a henna party is a sure way to make ‘Eid extra ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As far back as I can remember, I have always associated henna with ‘Eid, even more so than weddings. I don’t remember a single night before ‘Eid where the ladies of our house didn’t stay up late painting our hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beauty of henna aside, its blessings lie in its ability to bring women together and magnify the joy that floods special occasions like ‘Eid. Sitting together, we admire our handiwork; tease one another about weed-like patterns that may have resulted; massage one another’s hands when they cramp; chase kids who might smudge henna on the furniture; scratch one another’s backs when an itch occurs; then compare hands the next morning – whose hands stained the darkest? Henna gatherings are incredible in the way they increase love amongst women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing women with bare hands on ‘Eid makes me feel quite sad; in my opinion, everyone should have a friend or family member with some henna skills! It’s not a difficult art to master, it just requires practice and a little creativity. You don’t need to be a pro to gather people together – henna is beautiful even with its simplicity. So here’s a quick henna guide to prepare you for an awesome henna gathering this ‘Eid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba0404;"><strong>Henna paste mix</strong></span><br />
Fresh henna cones are available from henna suppliers but you can mix your own if you’re feeling ambitious.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba0404;"><em>Things you will need</em></span><br />
• 30g pre-sifted henna powder<br />
• Lemon juice (fresh or bottled)<br />
• Eucalyptus oil/any essential oil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a glass/ceramic bowl mix the henna powder with a little bit of lemon juice a little at a time, until it becomes a paste – neither too thick nor too runny (a little runnier than toothpaste)<br />
Mix well with a few drops of eucalyptus oil.<br />
Cover with cling film and leave in a warm place for 12 hours/overnight.<br />
Fill empty henna cones available from henna suppliers, or you can DIY by rolling a square of florist cellophane and securing with sellotape. The mixture should make 2-3 small henna cones.<br />
You can store henna cones in the fridge for a few days, or pop them into the freezer, but allow 24 hours thawing time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba0404;"><strong>Design tips</strong></span><br />
Henna designs may seem complex, but they are just a number of motifs repeated in different sizes with good placement</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to avoid doodling, avoid freestyling and be sure of the design before you start. There’s a lot of inspiration online, so head over to Google and print off henna designs before you start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best place to start a henna design is from the middle, where the main feature of the design is usually located. On the hands, begin in the middle of the palm, work up the arm and then back towards the fingers. On the legs, begin in the middle of the foot, work up the leg and then back towards the toes. This will help with placement and also prevent accidental smudging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Henna is most beautiful when the lines are crisp and clear, and yet look effortless and curve naturally. Hold the henna cone a few millimetres above the skin with a gentle, even pressure, keeping your hand steady but not stiff. If the henna is of good quality, the paste should glide out in the direction you move it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When drawing motifs, such as leaves or paisleys, sketch the outline of the shape before filling it in. Begin flowers from the middle and work outwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never underestimate the creative power of dots when used in moderation! Triangles or tiny flowers made up of small dots can make all the difference to a pattern and are excellent fillers. Other finishing touches like lines and shading add depth to the design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you aren’t confident with intricate designs, then bold henna designs also look beautiful, especially large flowers, leaves or paisleys on the back of the hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decorating dried henna patterns with glitter and rhinestones can really turn the henna party up a notch. Glitter cones are available from henna suppliers, and rhinestones can be glued with body/eyelash glue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba0404;"><strong>Enhancing/maintaining henna stains</strong></span><br />
Wash and exfoliate the skin before you begin – lotions and dead skin can prevent henna from penetrating the skin properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the henna is dry, mix 3 parts lemon juice and 1 part sugar in a bowl and gently pat this onto the design using a cotton ball: this will enhance the colour and prevent the henna from crumbling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best conditions for a good henna stain are heat and moisture: keep your body warm and keep the henna design wet for as long as possible by reapplying the lemon and sugar mixture each time it dries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once fully dried, wrap the area with toilet paper/bandage gauze and secure with medical tape to prevent crumbling during the night. For best results, keep the henna on for 8-12 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the morning, remove the henna by rubbing with a cotton ball dipped in olive oil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To preserve the stain, try not to wash your hands excessively, and use rubber gloves when washing dishes. Henna can dry out, so keep the area well-moisturised with oil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba0404;"><strong>Other henna uses</strong></span><br />
Henna has been used for thousands of years for medicinal purposes due to its inherent cooling qualities; applying henna to the hair and feet is not only beautifying but is also a great treatment for anyone suffering from burning sensations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Henna on the nails is a great, wudhu-friendly alternative to nail polish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Henna has also become a broader form of art practised on various mediums beyond the body: on canvases for hanging art, on wooden boxes, even on candles to display in the home. The designs are not just limited to henna paste, but can also be transferred onto tote bags and T-shirts using fabric paints, or even onto cakes with an icing cone.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up as a non-Muslim, I have fond memories of celebrating Christmas, even though my family were not religious. We would prepare for the day long before, setting up a Christmas tree and decorating the house with garlands and shiny baubles. For my first Eid as a new Muslim, I had a great sense of excitement as the day approached, as well as a melancholic feeling at the thought of the blessed month of Ramadhan finishing and the resumption of normal life. But the day itself was an anti-climax in the sense that I wasn’t able to recreate the magical feeling of my childhood. Firstly because I wasn’t with family, but also because I didn’t prepare for it in the same way as I used to do for Christmas. Yes, I did bake some biscuits, and I loved the early morning prayers in the mosque, the chants of “Allahu Akbar” and the sight of children in their best attire, but I didn’t know what to do with myself the rest of the day. Now, with a toddler daughter who will probably remember this year’s Ramadhan and Eid as her first ones, I am determined to make it a magical period for her, and to create family traditions that we can reproduce every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To welcome the last iftar of Ramadhan and the start of the holiday, I like the idea of creating a peaceful, spiritual atmosphere with candles and flowers. It is very easy to create patterned candle-holders with glass jars and paint, and it can make a nice activity to do with the children during the long days of fasting, especially as Ramadhan falls in the summer holidays in the UK this year. I love Moroccan lanterns, and I have found that tea glasses work great with tea candles. I also make an effort with table decorations: even a patterned napkin and a nice set of plates can create a special atmosphere fit for the Arabian nights!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, the morning of Eid should be child-orientated: unlike Eid-ul-Adha, when the first day of celebrations is often devoted to the sacrifice of the sheep and the preparation of the meat, Eid-ul-Fitr is all about rejoicing and relaxing after a month of fasting and restrictions. There are many ways to make your house ready for such a joyous occasion: garlands, balloons, bunting and other baubles. You can make an “Eid Mubarak” bunting with triangles cut out from fabric or crepe paper &#8211; that’s another afternoon of activities for the kids sorted! I found a large selection of ideas for making your own decorations online, using cheap materials and staying in line with Muslim culture, rather than using Christmas baubles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same goes for food: there are lots of accessories and inspirational ideas available online to make your own special Eid cakes and biscuits: star-shaped cookies, fondant decorations representing mosques, calligraphy written with an icing pen… And of course, an abundance of halal sweets! I’m a real sucker for healthy food, but Eid is the one occasion when I will allow my children (and myself) to enjoy a sugary treat. Allah has forbidden us to fast on the days of Eid; and since Ramadhan is all about fasting and not midnight feasts (yes, I’m looking at you, demanding husbands), Eid is the day to create a sumptuous meal to be remembered. Of course, I don’t suggest you spend the day in the kitchen &#8211; many treats can be bought, or prepared in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eid is very much about sharing food and joy with your close ones and the wider Muslim community, and for this reason I adore Eid cards. Not being able to spend Eid with my family, I have at least the pleasure of selecting a beautiful card to send them, with pictures of our celebration. There is such a wide selection available online and in Islamic shops nowadays that it would be a shame not to use them: calligraphy, crescent moons, pictures of mosques… You can also make your own! To exchange gifts, I find that a detail such as using gift paper rather than presenting it in a bag is a thoughtful touch, and there is nothing more enjoyable than the sight of children shredding the paper to find out what is inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to assure you that creating a wonderful, special celebration doesn’t need to come at a high price. You will find that you cherish the decorations you and your children have made with your own hands more than standard ones, and you can keep them for the years to come. A beautiful house is not about expensive furniture and fancy decorations, but rather about creating a welcoming atmosphere and adding personal touches that make you feel at home.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Na’ima B. Robert offers tips on maintaining momentum and stepping it up for the last ten days of Ramadhan.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid a flurry of anticipation, Ramadhan begins and we throw ourselves headlong into ‘ibadah: fasting, reciting the Qur’an, praying taraweeh and doing as many more good deeds as we can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All too soon, the full moon appears in the sky, the month is half over and our thoughts inevitably turn to the last ten days of Ramadhan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘A’isha (RA) reported that, during the last ten days, the Prophet (SAW) would exert himself in worship more than at any other time of the year<em><span style="color: #999999;"> (Muslim)</span></em>.</p>
<p>This included spending the nights in prayer, waking his wives up to pray and performing I’tikaf, and secluding himself in the masjid in order to concentrate on ‘ibadah. The Prophet (SAW) encouraged the Muslims to do likewise and to seek out Laylat-ul-Qadr, the night which is better than one thousand months. It is clear from the sunnah that the last ten days of Ramadhan should have a singular focus: the worship of Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
However, for many of us, we find it hard to maintain a high level of effort in our ‘ibadah after halfway through Ramadhan. By the time the last ten days come around, we may find ourselves actually slowing down, our resolve to make the most of Ramadhan weaker rather than stronger. Be it due to the fasting taking its toll on us physically, our own weakened iman or disappointment with our efforts thus far, we may start to suffer from a lack of momentum, leading to an unfulfilling ten days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It doesn’t have to be this way, bi‘idhnillah. If we make a conscious effort to pace ourselves and plan our ‘ibadah in these ten days and nights, we have a better chance of making them really count. Here are some tips to help you make the most of these blessed days and nights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #0786b8;"><strong>1. Make intention</strong></span><br />
Remind yourself of the importance of the last ten days of Ramadhan and make a sincere intention to truly exert yourself and increase in worship, just as Rasoolullah (SAW) used to do. We know that actions are by intentions so, by making a specific intention not to let these blessed days pass you by, you are setting yourself up to make a true effort and earning the reward for the intended good deed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #0786b8;"><strong>2. Make a plan</strong></span><br />
The ten days pass by so quickly, it can be easy to watch them slip away without truly benefiting, especially if fasting fatigue has set in or you are pre-occupied with entertaining or planning for ‘Eid. Take some time to think about and write down what you would like to accomplish in those days and review each day, adjusting your goals as the days go by. Insha Allah, if you make a realistic plan and set smart goals, you will achieve more than you ever thought possible in this blessed period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0786b8;"><strong>3. Clear the decks</strong></span><br />
Now is not the time to be planning elaborate iftar parties or large gatherings. Simplify, simplify, simplify in these precious remaining days, stripping each day back to its bare essentials. If you can take time off work, do so. If you can delay deadlines, do so. If you can plan your more demanding social obligations for earlier in the month, do so. Potlucks, one-pot meals and cooking in bulk and freezing will all free up more time for ‘ibadah. Even if you can’t avoid spending time in the kitchen or rushing around in the car running errands, make every second count by keeping your mushaf close by, playing Qur’an recitations or listening to beneficial lectures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0786b8;"><strong>4. Unplug</strong></span><br />
These ten days should be reserved for ‘ibadah and the true essentials of life. Anything else should be put on hold, particularly entertainment and non-beneficial activities. It might be a good idea to unplug from social media during this time to minimise distractions. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest are all great sources of information, communication and entertainment but there comes a time when these social networks become intrusive. If you find that you are checking your Twitter timeline more often than you are picking up a mushaf, particularly during these last ten days, you may be in need of a social media detox. Update your status with a ‘Closed for 10 days’ and log off – your ‘ibadah routine is sure to benefit bi’idhnillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0786b8;"><strong>5. Team up</strong></span><br />
Don’t try to go it alone. Enlist the help and support of your family (kids included!) and friends to make these ten days a time of striving for the Akhirah. Share reminders about the last ten days and discuss ways in which you can help each other stay on track. By this time, many of us may find our strength and enthusiasm starting to wane so this is the ideal time to provide support and encouragement. Can you share iftar with another family to cut down on kitchen time, or offer to swap babysitting services so that another sister can go to the masjid to pray taraweeh? Can you agree to share childcare with your husband to enable you both to pray Qiyam in the masjid or make I’tikaf? If you can, make a plan!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0786b8;"><strong>6. Get ‘Eid prep out of the way</strong></span><br />
It is easy to allow preparing for ‘Eid to impact negatively on your time at the end of Ramadhan. When you become busy with planning festivities, buying gifts, getting hair and henna done plus a million other things, your mind is pre-occupied with what are, let’s face it, dunyah-related concerns. Don’t let ‘Eid prep steal your blessings during these last few days. Make a concerted effort to plan your celebrations ahead of time: decide what you will be doing early and send out invitations, make bookings, plan your outfit, whatever it is you need to do before the month draws to a close. Get your ‘Eid shopping out of the way, shop online, streamline or delegate so that you can get it all done in less time, leaving you more time to focus on worship. That way, your ‘Eid celebrations won’t be tinged with regret at having wasted your ‘ibadah time on frivolities – and you’ll truly be ready to party!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #0786b8;"><strong>7. Strive, strive, strive</strong></span><br />
If you have found your energy flagging as the month draws to a close, now is the time to pull it back. You know the rewards of these ten days; you know that you may not live to see the next Ramadhan so make a sincere effort to push yourself, to fight against fatigue and go that extra mile. Eat for strength and take power naps in the day to enable you to stand the night in prayer, seeking Laylat-ul-Qadr and the blessings of your Lord. That way, when the new moon of Shawwal appears, you can finally relax, secure in the knowledge that you gave this blessed month your all – that you honoured your Ramadhan guest &#8211; and are ready to enjoy the blessings of Allah (SWT) on the days of ‘Eid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
TaqabbalAllah minna wa minkum<br />
May Allah (SWT) accept it from us and you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #999999;"><em>Na’ima B. Robert hopes to do justice to the last ten days of Ramadhan – and is determined to get her ‘Eid sorted way ahead of time in order to be able to fully focus on the job at hand: ‘ibadah.</em></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Bint Abdel Hamid reflects on how the internet has brought us both closer to and farther away from the spirit of charity. 
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the expansive canvas that is the internet, reading the news, searching for information, randomly browsing its pages, I see it. It is the picture of a dark-skinned child, African I think, hunched over in hunger, in agony, in hopelessness, body emaciated. The child – hairless so that I can’t tell if he’s a boy or she’s a girl – is so thin, skin wrapped tightly around the bumps and pokes of bones too-small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder what photographer could have captured this image without shattering the lens to his own heart, without lying down, curling up, and weeping in guilt over all the extra-helpings and excessive dinners eaten over the years. I wonder what photographer did not drop everything, search for food, give up her own lunch, pull it out of her own mouth, in order to feed this child. So much skin and bones on someone so small is devastating enough in picture; to see this child in person seems like too much to bear.  This child I am describing, this child whose image haunts the public domain of the internet and the collective conscious of mankind, is not new to me. I have seen this child before, elsewhere, and I am not surprised to hear that you have, too. It is the same child. It is the same child, I tell myself, the same image, for to think – to realise the truth – that this state of existence belongs, not to a single child, but to nations and generations of children is also too much to bear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was too much to bear. Because it seems the internet has not been entirely oblivious to this child who could have been our son or our daughter had Allah only decreed it to be so, may Allah protect us and our children. The expansive canvas that is the internet expands further, with new pages and new scenes, new ways to raise awareness and ease the pain of the child. I travel across it and find new sites. These are sites that encourage charity and helping those in need, facilitating monetary donations by easy transfer from bank accounts, encouraging the collection of supplies, food, clothes, books, gathering the resources from people who need only be willing to give.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, a few sites catch my attention. They are a new type of site, ones that allow you to give by simply clicking the button of your mouse. Take these for example: freerice.com, a vocabulary game that donates 20 grains of rice for every entry answered correctly; and a similar freepoverty.com, a geography game that helps donate water, clean water, to people badly in need of it – and who knew that clean water was such an issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I pause, and I think these sites are perfect for me. They are convenient and automated, like so much else I am used to in life; they are easy. They remind me to take a break from my normal clicking activities to intend and click a little for a cause. A break from work, they are beneficial to others and educational to me. It is all a win-win-win situation. I rejoice, because I see in the internet a solution to humanity’s twin suffering and guilt. Allah (SWT) says in the Qur’an: <em><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>“By no means shall you attain piety unless you spend of that which you love”</strong> </span><span style="color: #999999;">(Aal-Imran: 92)</span></em>. Elsewhere, Allah (SWT) describes those slaves of His who will go to jannah, saying that<br />
<em><strong><span style="color: #008080;">“they give food, in spite of their love for it, to the poor, the orphan, and the captive”</span> </strong><span style="color: #999999;">(Al-Insan: 8)</span></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recall again that clicking a mouse button requires no sacrifice on my part. Sacrifice is that act of pulling the food out of my own mouth, at a time when I am hungry, and giving it to the starving child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
And contact? There is nothing I can think or say on this matter that the Prophet (SAW) did not say better. In the collections of Bukhari and Muslim, it is narrated that the Prophet (SAW) said, “The best of charity is that which leaves you still independent of means, and the upper hand (the one that gives) is better than the lower hand (the one that receives), and start with those who are under your care.” He (SAW) also said, “Bring the orphan close to you, wipe his head and give him some of your food, for that will soften your heart and fulfill your need” <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah)</span></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I reflect on either of these traditions, I see in them a command to be near those you are giving to, or perhaps simply to give to those who are near.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I think back to those sites, freerice, freepoverty, freeotherthings.com, and I think no less of them. What brilliance, to be able to help people I might never otherwise be able to, people thousands of miles away! What creativity to turn it into a beneficial game, an asset to both the giving and receiving ends! Certainly, as long as there are people in need, there is no reason to limit the ways and means of aiding them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
But I think also of contact and sacrifice, those two ingredients that contribute so much to the spirit of charity. I think of what it means to see and know the child behind the heart-wrenching image. I think of how interaction can lend strength to a community, and how sacrifice can bring purification to the soul. I think of all these and I know: I must incorporate these aspects more often into the act of truly giving.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Navin Siddiqui looks at tightening belts in the month of self-discipline and restraint.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Ramadhan upon us, our minds are focused on the barakah that we want to obtain and all the good deeds that we want to squeeze into our day. Thinking about the amount of self-control that we use during Ramadhan, there is a real opportunity for us to master this discipline on a larger scale. With all the effort we put into making our Ramadhan great, we have the untapped potential to make other aspects of our life great as well. Take the opportunity this Ramadhan to get your personal finances in shape. Utilise this discipline and motivation to get out of debt: in other words, let Ramadhan be your financial manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world of self-gratification, where society encourages us to say, do and be whatever we want, Islam teaches us control and discipline for self-preservation. Let’s look at this from the aspect of money and transactions. When going to the mall, passing by a store, reading a magazine or observing another person’s possessions, our nature to want what we don’t have comes through like a bolt of lightning. What is it then, that stops us from going out and getting what we want if we can have it? It is our ability to control ourselves and our actions. During Ramadhan this same ability kicks into hyperdrive. Our senses are heightened and our minds are much more aware of what we are doing, thinking and feeling. This is exactly the state that we need to be in if we want to develop good money habits that will stick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you are reading this, make the intention right now to get out of debt and manage your money better. Intend to do this for the sake of Allah (SWT). Anything done for the sake of Allah (SWT) has the ability to heighten our awareness, because our love of Allah (SWT) encourages us to do the task well. An intention has to be like a decision that you make with absolute and unwavering certainty. It is not a wish or a dream; it is something you really want to accomplish with focus and determination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have made your intention, make du’a to Allah (SWT) for this to be easy and attainable, and for the month of Ramadhan to act as a foundation for what you have intended. The ability to ask Allah (SWT) for help and support is a wonderful gift and it holds great powers of motivation for the one who is asking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get your financial situation organised before Ramadhan. One common aspect that prevents us from doing this regularly is being in debt. However, what’s interesting is that you feel less in debt once you have organised yourself. Knowing exactly what you owe is more comforting than not knowing, even with large debts. Create a budget for the rest of the year that covers all your major and fun expenses, anticipates surprises, and leaves room for some savings. You also want to cease all impulse purchases immediately; they eat into your budget and you are left scrambling to balance the rest of the month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about where you will spend most of your time during Ramadhan. These are places where you are susceptible to unplanned spending. At work, depending on the season, there might be events that you are asked to participate in that require you to pay. Be wary of these. Also, If you are someone who buys lunch at work often, you will actually save money during Ramadhan. However, the masjid is a great place to spend your money because you are spending in the way of Allah (SWT). Often, larger masjids have shops that you might want to be careful about visiting to prevent impulse purchases. Make sure that your budget includes money that you want to give to the masjid so that you are not making that decision at the last minute. The most risky time is when you are shopping. Studies show that an empty stomach can impact a person’s ability to make decisions. This is especially true when making financial decisions and purchases. Being aware of one’s own tendencies and the surrounding risks can aid in reducing the likelihood of unplanned spending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be mindful of your critical spending moments and budget for them before Ramadhan. The month of Ramadhan is such that all good deeds are multiplied. This includes charitable donations and what better time to give sadaqah than in this month? It is common for many to give their annual zakah in this month in addition to Zakat-ul-Fitr. If you are amongst them, then be prepared with your calculations so that you are confident and organised about how much to give.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramadhan can be your financial boot camp, if you let it. Monitor and change your financial habits during this month and you are sure to see an improvement. Maintain this practice beyond Ramadhan and before you know it, debt and financial trouble will be a thing of the past, Insha Allah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Shahin Vohra discusses the miraculous experience and challenges of being pregnant during the blessed month of Ramadhan.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always found something incredible about being “with child” during the blessed month of Ramadhan. For me, it is the knowledge that whatever acts of worship I am doing for the pleasure of Allah (SWT), my unborn child is experiencing them with me; reciting the Qur’an, praying tahajjud or taraweeh, engaging in dhikr and even preparing iftar for the family all felt so much more rewarding whilst carrying my baby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sacred month also highlights Allah&#8217;s (SWT) immense mercy on women, by allowing us exemption from fasting. However, fasting or not, being pregnant in Ramadhan brings both joy and challenges. I spoke to four women who shared their experiences of Ramadhan with their bump.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saba: I was in my second trimester and Ramadhan was here. I remember the extreme exhaustion I felt and had chosen not to fast. I visited a friend who was also pregnant, and I assumed she wouldn’t be fasting either. I remember asking for a glass of water and my friend’s mother exclaimed “Why aren’t you fasting?!” At first I was a bit confused by the question and didn’t really reply, so aunty just continued, “We all fasted when we were pregnant, back in Pakistan, in the heat, never missed one fast!” I just responded with a nervous “Did you?” She made me feel as though I was cutting corners and just being lazy and using pregnancy as my excuse. When I thought about it later, I probably should have said; “Well actually, my Lord has gifted us this provision. There is no hardship in my deen, and I am allowed to be excused from fasting, I am considering the well being of my child and myself”. Instead, that experience left me feeling embarrassed and questioning my decision. I never ate or drank in public again for the rest of that Ramadhan!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamanna: Living with in-laws meant having to fast during Ramadhan whilst pregnant. I didn’t think I could choose not to fast because everyone else was fasting around me. I also felt well enough, so I didn’t see any reason to miss any fasts. I soon changed my mind! Living with in-laws meant cooking iftar for a lot of people. This meant I had very little time for worship or rest. It was after the first few fasts that the extreme weakness kicked in, totally overwhelming me. I recall almost passing out whilst preparing iftar for the masses! After this, I decided not to fast and begged Allah (SWT) to excuse me and to make the pregnancy easy for me, enabling me to be able to continue with other acts of worship during this precious month. In reality, it was as though I was still fasting anyway because I’d have to sneak food into my room so others in the family wouldn’t notice that I wasn’t fasting &#8211; even though I should have been confident in the fact that Allah has given me this exemption and I shouldn’t have had to feel so secretive about it. I guess at the time I would have met with a lot of disapproval from my in-laws, so I decided to secretly hide stashes of food in my room for when hunger consumed me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nadia: I was halfway through my pregnancy, and it was a hot Ramadhan. I chose to fast because I felt fine and after discussing it with my doctor, I felt I wasn’t at any risk if I was to fast, and the baby would be fine too, insha Allah. I started keeping fasts on alternate days, so as not to burn myself out totally, as the days were long and I had three other children to keep me on my feet all day! Alhamdulillah, I felt fine on the days that I did fast. I made sure I rested plenty and had a healthy suhoor to keep me going in the day. On the days when I did not fast, I tried to keep the routine of waking for tahajjud, reciting more Qur’an and lots of nafl prayers. This helped me stay in the momentum of Ramadhan as it was important for me to stay connected with this amazing month of forgiveness and blessings. I didn’t want to feel I’d missed out on any barakah at all.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rukhsana: My experience of pregnancy in Ramadhan was of mixed emotions. I felt honoured that Allah (SWT) had allowed me the option of not fasting in order to protect my unborn child and myself, but I also felt guilty. My husband was the only one fasting in our house as my mother in-law was unable to fast due to ill health. I’m not sure if it was the hormones, but I remember feeling slightly “left out” in this precious month, as though my husband was more connected with Allah (SWT) and was reaping the rewards of this month fully, whereas I had feelings of emptiness because I wasn’t able to share the joys of fasting. I think my inner dynamic was leaving me spiritually depleted and I really craved what everyone else was enjoying &#8211; the “spiritual high”.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #e6b087;">“Allah intends for you ease and He does not intend for you hardship” </span></strong><span style="color: #999999;">(Surah Baqarah:185)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that Allah (SWT), in His Infinite Mercy, has given women such an honour as to offer us the choice to fast or not whilst pregnant also places a responsibility on us to use our wisdom to make the best choice. In all cases, we should consult our doctor and discuss the effects of fasting on our baby and our own health. If a pregnant woman decides to fast then she should ensure she has plenty of rest in the day, especially when the days are long and hot. She should also eat the right foods for suhoor, which will equip her with ample energy throughout the day. Aside from the physical considerations, whether fasting or not, she must also be aware of her spiritual well-being as this can provide immense pleasure and fulfillment for the soul, something which surely impacts the well-being of the baby also. Ramadhan brings the chance for an intense connection with our Lord, one that we can achieve through both physical and spiritual acts of worship. How honoured is the childbearing mother who can impart this experience to her child before he or she is even born into this Dunya.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366;">Take a good proportion out of your day simply to just read and reflect, even if it is just on one verse &#8211; only then will you benefit from its pearls and gain a spiritual connection with your Lord.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s that time of year again where the Qur’an is taken off the dusty bookshelf and opened in order for the beautiful words of Allah (SWT) to be recited. The Qur’an itself is a miracle. With each letter recited, Allah (SWT) promises reward; do we ever wonder about the beauty behind these words? Why do they possess such a high reward and how can we make the most of it this Ramadhan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah</strong></span><span style="color: #999999;"> (Al-Baqarah:2)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Often we think the Qu’ran is a book of dos, don’ts and historical references about the people that have come before us. But if we were to follow the Qur’an every step of the way in all aspects of life, it would no doubt plant a seed that will one day flourish into a garden of perpetual bliss. In order for us to begin to understand the divine words, we should take a look at our beloved Prophet (SAW). He took the words of the message, not only to be recited, but also to be practiced, in his actions, speech and direct worship to Allah (SWT). In fact, everything that the Prophet (SAW) did was in accordance with the Qu’ran – this is why he (SAW) was a messenger of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>The magnificent beauty</strong></span><br />
Before even opening the Qu’ran, we must understand the masterpiece at hand. It is not any old ‘life’ book written by a random psychologist, but a manual, a guide, from the Creator of the heavens and the earth – Allah (SWT) – and what better guide to have than from the one who created us? Just as a mobile phone manufacturer puts together a ‘how to use’ manual so the customer not only knows how to use it, but also how to make the most out of it, the glorious Qur’an has been sent down in order to guide His creation to be the best people possible, and actually understand what it means to be a true Muslim. Once we accept this, we break down the barrier that is wedged between our hearts and what lies beneath the embellished front cover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong><em>And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me </em></strong></span><em><span style="color: #996922;"><span style="color: #999999;">(Adh-Dhariyat:56)</span></span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Understanding</strong></span><br />
To understand the Qu’ran, people think we must learn Arabic; this is encouraged and will no doubt allow a deeper understanding, which a translation will not be able to provide. The words of Allah (SWT) are incredibly deep in their meaning, to embrace every single word, we must avoid trying to race through its 114 chapters. This year as Ramadhan falls in the summer holidays, it’s a great opportunity to just get stuck in! Take a good proportion out of your day simply to just read and reflect, even if it is just on one verse &#8211; only then will you benefit from its pearls and gain a spiritual connection with your Lord. Quality is always better than quantity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Go out and live it</strong></span><br />
Once we have reflected and taken some lessons, it’s important that we put it into practice.  Based on our willingness to sacrifice for God, and if we live in a state of taqwa (God-consciousness), our daily routine can become an act of worship, walking the walk of the Qur’an itself. This can be something really simple: Allah (SWT) mentions in the Qur&#8217;an on many occasions the status of parents, so help your mum prepare for iftar in the evening. Even though she may not look it, she is actually as hungry and tired as you are and she would no doubt appreciate the extra pair of hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Don’t spend your days sleeping!</strong></span><br />
The fourth pillar of Islam is charity; find out where you can become a volunteer during the holidays; there will be lots of fundraising activities going on over Ramadhan. Or perhaps even start a project with your friends in your local area where you can get creative, have fun and gain some reward. This will also be great in building on your work experience; it’s a win-win opportunity! Build on your knowledge by attending Islamic classes. The Prophet (SAW) said “Allah makes the way to Jannah easy for him who treads the path in search of knowledge.&#8221;<em><span style="color: #999999;"> (Muslim)</span></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Ramadhan is a great time to develop your iman when even the atmosphere is spiritually boosting; use the time to cut out all the useless pastimes and replace it with that which is beneficial. When Ramadhan is over, you won’t want to go back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong><em>And We send down of the Qur&#8217;an that which is healing and mercy for the believers, but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss.</em></strong></span> <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Al-’Isra:82)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
What better time to start this quest into the Qur’an and recharge our spiritual batteries than in the month of mercy? All we need to do is to lift the Qur’an from the bookshelf, open it, and with a little spark of love, determination and patience, start to understand exactly why Allah (SWT) has put us on this earth. Let’s do this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Dr Hina J Shahid explains the multitude of health benefits that can be attained in Ramadhan.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ramadhan is one of the holiest months for Muslims, a time enriched with spiritual benefits, but the effects don’t just stop there. There are many physical, mental and social health benefits too. Unfortunately, we often overlook and don’t attain all the other health benefits of Ramadhan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Qur’an we are informed that the purpose of fasting is to increase <i>taqwa</i> (Qur’an Al-Baqarah :183). The translation of <i>taqwa</i> has many shades of meaning including awareness, mindfulness, consciousness and fear of Allah (SWT), as well as self-restraint and piety. If we reflect upon this for a minute, we can see that being conscious and mindful extends to <i>everything</i> we do in Ramadhan and the choices we make (and don’t make), including in relation to our health, which has been described as the greatest blessing after faith by our Beloved Prophet (SAW).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b>What happens to the body during fasting? </b></span></p>
<p>The medical definition of fasting is not eating or drinking for more than eight hours. Normally the main source of energy for the body is glucose, the simplest carbohydrate, which is stored in muscles and the liver. During fasting, glucose stores are the first to be mobilised to provide energy. When these run out, the body starts to burn fat to make energy which, results in weight loss. With prolonged fasting, also known as starvation, the body turns to protein for energy, which can result in the breakdown of muscles, which is harmful for health. Starvation is unlikely to be reached in Ramadhan because the fasting state is broken every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The body cannot store water, and the only way of conserving water is by reducing the amount of urine produced by the kidneys. Feeling mildly dehydrated with symptoms such as thirst, headache and difficulty concentrating are experienced by most people but if you feel dizzy, faint or disorientated then you will need urgent rehydration with fluids containing salt and sugar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fasting can help with weight loss, but heavy iftars replete with rich food items means many of us end up gaining weight instead of losing it. Fasting can improve glucose control in people with diabetes, reduce blood pressure, reduce blood cholesterol levels and overall risk of heart disease, boost immunity and regulate food binges. After a few days of fasting, there is a rise in the level of endorphins, also known as “happy hormones”, which makes us feel more alert and positive. The strong community spirit palpable in Ramadhan and focus on charity and self-regulation of our actions, emotions and behaviours, all help improve our relationships with ourselves and others, contributing to improved mental and social well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b>Reaping healthy blessing in Ramadhan</b></span></p>
<p>Below are eight things you can do this Ramadhan to maintain your health in a holistic way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b><b>Eat healthy </b></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are instructed in the Qur’an (Al-Baqarah :168) to eat food that is both <i>halal</i> and <i>tayyib</i> (good for you). It is important to eat a balanced diet during Ramadhan, which should be based on eating the right proportion of carbohydrates, proteins, fats and dairy and making sure you eat plenty of fruit, vegetables and include nuts and fish. You should have your two meals a day, as tempting as it might be to skip suhoor out of fear of disrupting your sleep. Your suhoor will provide you with the essential energy and nutrients you need to carry you through the rest of the day, so it is important to make sure you wake up and eat a nutritious and wholesome meal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Base your meals on complex carbohydrates and fibre-rich foods, which are digested slowly and allow for sustained release of energy, making you feel full for longer. These include wholemeal flour, wholegrain bread, basmati rice, wheat, oats, barley, semolina, cereal, quinoa, and potatoes (with skin). Combine these with healthy proteins such as fish, eggs and white meat, or vegetarian proteins such as beans and pulses. Add healthy fats such as nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocadoes, and include yogurt, milk, low fat cheese for some dairy and calcium. You can include a healthy salad and soup for starters, which are rich in vitamins, minerals and fluid, and have fruit –based desserts instead of traditional sugary sweets. Dates provide natural sugars, are full of energy and fluid, and are rich in vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important aspect of healthy eating is portion sizes. Keep your portion sizes reasonable and avoid the temptation to have second and third rounds. Instead make sure you have healthy starters and plenty of fluids to prevent over indulgence and improve your fluid and nutrient intake. Counting your calories when you are buying and consuming food can help ensure you do not consume excess energy which can lead to weight gain. Average recommended intake for women is 2000kcal (84000kJ) and for men 2500kcal (10,500kJ), but this varies according to individual body composition, metabolism and activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b><b>Avoid unhealthy foods</b></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people associate Ramadhan with our favourite fried foods, such as samosas and pakoras, which are rich in calories and saturated fat that raise blood cholesterol and cause weight gain. Avoid deep fried foods, replacing them with healthier options. For the same reason, high fat-foods such as parathas, biscuits, pastries and chips should be avoided. Replace sugary drinks and desserts with healthier options, you should not have more than 30g/day of <i>free</i> sugar (seven teaspoons) as too much sugar is associated with diabetes, weight gain and tooth decay. Salt intake should be restricted to 6g/day, as this has been shown to reduce blood pressure, and therefore overall heart risk. Red meat is consumed in abundance in our communities. However, this should be restricted to 70g/day, and if possible limited to a couple of times a week, as excess red meat and processed meats have been linked to bowel cancer, as well as being high in fat content. As a guide, three thin-cut slices of roast lamb or beef are 90g, a quarter pounder is 78g, a large doner kebab is almost twice the recommended daily intake at 130g and a grilled 8oz beef steak is over twice the recommended intake at 163g. Learning to read and interpret nutritional labels every time you buy food can help you check what your eating and turn it into a habit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b><b>Use healthy cooking options</b></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If using oil, use healthier options such as olive oil or pure coconut oil and try shallow frying instead of deep frying, or avoid frying altogether and instead bake, steam or boil your food. You can substitute salt with herbs, spices and lemon to add flavour, but be careful not to add too much as they can make you feel thirsty, as well as cause indigestion and heartburn. Replace sugary desserts with fruit or milk-based desserts and puddings. Try and shop for locally produced seasonal fruit and vegetables and eat wholesome foods whenever you can. If you are in a rush, you can look for healthy and halal-convenient options, but planning meals and recipes in advance can help avoid this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b><b>Drink plenty of water </b></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Our body is two-thirds water and it is important to keep hydrated. Aim to drink around two litres of fluid a day even during Ramadhan and try and space this out during the non-fasting hours. Taking a bottle of water to taraweeh prayers and sipping on this during prayer breaks can help you consume a reasonable amount of fluid gradually. You should avoid caffeine-based drinks as caffeine is a diuretic and stimulates water loss. An alternative is unsweetened herbal teas. Adding yogurt to meals as well as fluid rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, soups, stews, cereals, porridge, muesli (with milk or yogurt) can also help you get more fluid. Be mindful of fruit juices and smoothies which can be high in sugar and calories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b><b>Do physical activity</b></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are doing physical activity, it is important to do the right type at the right time. This also depends on your baseline fitness level as training whilst fasting can be harmful for health. Amongst elite athletes there are those who are able to fast during Ramadhan, but equally there are many who are not able to and this is very much an individual factor. You are encouraged to consult with your General Practitioner, personal trainer, physical therapist, or sports specialist, especially if you are relatively inexperienced, or have any long term medical conditions, or are recovering from an injury or complication. Going for a light walk after iftar can help with digestion as well as help you get some exercise. If you are planning to do a cardio workout, experts suggest that the best time to train is before suhoor, to ensure maximum fat loss. If this is too early, an alternative is an hour after a light iftar, although other experts recommend delaying this for at least 2-3 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b><b>Get enough sleep</b></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a big challenge for lots of people, especially with late taraweeh and early suhoor interrupting our regular sleep patterns. Sleep deprivation can lower mental performance and also has negative physical health effects. Ideally you should try and get as close to eight hours sleep as possible, for example having lunch time naps if work permits or having a nap after work and before iftar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b><b>Medications and vaccinations</b></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking oral medications will invalidate your fasting but it is often possible to change the dosing regime of your medication and you should see your GP before Ramadhan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people stop taking essential medication or change the timing without consulting their GP or pharmacist. <i>You should never stop taking a medication or alter the dose or regime without speaking to your GP or pharmacist.</i> There have been instances of serious interactions and complications. Regarding other routes of medication, there are some religious and medical scholars who agree that medications that are inhaled, injected or applied to the eyes, skin, nose, ears, (except if there is a hole in the ear drum and excluding intravenous feeding), or anally and vaginally do not invalidate fasting. Similarly having a blood test or vaccination does not break the fast. You are recommended to consult your respected scholars for more details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b><b>Mental health and well-being</b></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramadhan is a time for deep reflection on our lives and our connection with the Almighty. Fasting increases gratitude, <i>shukr</i>, which has been shown in research to improve mental health. Reciting dhikr, dua and verses of the Holy Qur’an has a powerful calming effect on the mind. Doing extra prayers, such as <i>taraweeh</i> and <i>Qiyam ul Layl</i> (night prayer) can also help with attaining focus, concentration and peace of mind. These core Islamic practices, as well as <i>ihtikaf</i> (seclusion), performed by some (mainly men) in the last ten days of Ramadhan are the equivalent of mainstream practises of mindfulness and meditation, and there are some scholars who translate <i>taqwa</i>, the purpose of Ramadhan, as mindfulness. Meditation and mindfulness are gaining increasing popularity for managing stress, anxiety, low mood and depression and therefore Ramadhan has the potential to significantly improve our mental state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramadhan is also a time to practice self restraint, not just of food, drink and intimate relations, but also of the tongue and mind, and can help us improve relations with others and the way we see people and things around us. Attending group iftars or hosting iftars for friends, family or the less fortunate is a great way to connect with other people and share in the spirit of giving. All this can greatly improve our sense of well-being and purpose while simultaneously strengthening us spiritually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc9035;"><b>Final words</b></span></p>
<p>The benefits of Ramadhan on our general health and spirituality are enormous. In our communities in particular we are facing considerable health challenges around conditions that are directly related to food and lifestyle choices, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and certain cancers. Health is truly a blessing from Allah SWT, so let’s use this Ramadhan to be mindful of our health and wellbeing and adopt positive changes for ourselves, families and communities, that we can continue beyond Ramadhan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #333399;">On Saum &amp; Savouries</span></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><strong><em>Between the fasting and the feasting of Ramadhan in South Africa, Miriam Akabor relishes the impact Ramadhan has on her community in South Africa.</em> </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As a child, I knew that Ramadhan was approaching shortly when we received a large package of kajoor (dates) with “Compliments from the Vawda family” neatly printed on the attached label. Each Ramadhan, the Vawdas supplied the neighbourhood Muslims with dates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I think of Ramadhan, I think of a renewed sense of faith, spirituality and hope. Then I think of the food. Fasting, on the most basic level, is about abstaining from food. Yet as wives and mothers we are constantly challenged to provide the tastiest of meals, ironically, during Ramadhan. In South Africa, the majority of Muslim families go through a preparation phase a month or two before fasting begins. Families set aside days to prepare the samoosa and pie filling, make the pur and pastry, then start the daunting task of filling the samoosas and pies, which could take up to a week, depending on how big your family is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I come from the city of Durban, home to the largest mosque in the southern hemisphere – the Grey Street Mosque. The city has an eclectic mix of Muslims who come together during Ramadhan. A month before the fasting begins, the cramped spice shops begin their “Ramadhan Specials” on spices, almonds, barley, dates and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
When Ramadhan dawns, Muslims zealously welcome the month. Islamic radio stations and publications contribute to this fervour, reminding us that this year we can make a change in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
When the night of the first tarawih arrives, I know a month of momentous praying, additional Qur’an reading, attempts to better myself and fasting for one month lies ahead. And I embrace it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As a child, suhur was always filled with noise – the shouts from my mother to get out of bed, the clattering of dishes, the hum of the microwave. I always woke up to see my grandmother engrossed in prayer.  Now, as a married woman, the roles have shifted and I have to wake up first to prepare the food in the stillness of the night. A tradition amongst families is to drink almond milk during suhur, especially the hufadh, to improve their memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Work continues as usual for Muslims in my country during Ramadhan. When late afternoon approaches, the delicious aromas begin to emanate from the kitchens – a harbinger of iftar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I remember the fragrance of my mother’s fresh haleem (a broth made of barley), which was a must at iftar each day. Served with a spritz of lemon juice and naan (bread), haleem is a source of energy. In keeping with the charitable atmosphere of Ramadhan, steaming haleem and naan are distributed freely in mosques around the country during weekends. When you live in Durban, it’s not possible for a Ramadhan to pass without buying, at least once, fresh haleem and naan from Mullah’s Café in the city centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Iftar is also made at the mosques with womenfolk sending platters of samoosas, cutlets, pies and fritters served with chutney, and jugs of ice cold sharbat (pink milkshake made with sweet rose syrup) with sabja seeds (basil seeds). There is a genuine buzz amongst the men at the mosques each night for tarawih. Fathers, sons and brothers, from the young to the old, join the congregation. They do so and return home to enjoy a cold dessert, like falooda, before retiring to bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The month of fasting continues with Muslims preparing and distributing food parcels to the needy. Before we know it Eid is upon us and we find ourselves saying, “I can’t believe Ramadhan flew by so fast!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333399;">At Home With Ramadhan </span></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><strong><em>After converting to Christianity at missionary school, Hamiidah Kehinde-Muhammad, discovers the homing spirit of Ramadhan.</em> </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Great! Another Ramadhan was here and that meant hard labour in the kitchen! I was almost twelve and had just returned from my missionary primary school. I never knew my mum and my dad had sent me there because he felt boarding school was safer for me. I’d become a Christian while at school but I was back home now and my dad ordered me to start praying!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went on to attend a very popular and secular secondary school which only further alienated me from Islam. Ramadhan then only meant hard work to me. I didn’t like the long hours of hunger and thirst and I didn’t like the chores of preparing for iftar either. I did however enjoy eating suhur in a group and the feeling of belonging that it gave me. All my life I have wanted to belong. I just wanted to fit in and be a part of something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, the university of my choice closed down and I had to stay home much longer than I planned. That was probably the best ‘bad’ thing that ever happened to me! Staying at home with my family gave me an opportunity to study Muslims a little bit more. I discovered they weren’t backwards at all. Secretly, I decided to look into Islam. By the next Ramadhan, I was a revert and had found where I belonged!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could encourage a sense of belonging more than eating meals, especially iftar, from the same plate! In the North of Nigeria, it isn’t a strange thing to see people eating meals from the same plate. They eat together, laughing and exchanging stories about their day. It took a bit of getting used to but after a while, I could dip my hands right into that dish too. The display of food at iftar will always take one’s breath away, and though iftar shouldn’t be turned into a feast, there’s always enough for everybody. There are always dates, fruits, traditional drinks like kunu and zobo before the main meal of different types of tuwo and soups. Tuwo is very much like mashed potatoes but made from grains. People here enjoy spicy and peppery foods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It isn’t an odd thing to hear a voice, accompanied by a drum, announcing the arrival of the time of suhur in the South of Nigeria. Soon you hear the unmistakable sound of people rising to do his bidding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramadhan has remained extremely special to me since that first Ramadhan even if I wasn’t Muslim yet. In Ramadhan of 2001, I began wearing the niqab and just before Ramadhan last year, I met my husband! I’ve experienced many Ramadhans since that first one and I’ve not only found a sense of belonging, I’ve found a completely fulfilling way of life!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333399;">Fasting In The Wild West</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><strong><em>Mahdia Chowdhury describes Ramadhan in the cold Canadian city of Calgary. </em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experiences during the month of Ramadhan in Canada are essentially dependent on where one resides. Fasting in one of the fastest growing cities (Calgary) in Canada comes with some challenges. Most Muslims in Canada reside in the east while Calgary is situated in the west, inside an oil producing province. I went to a predominately multicultural High School, with a large Muslim population. However that didn’t make my Ramadhan experiences much easier. The majority of Muslims at my school did not fast. I only knew of a few who actually followed the requirements of Ramadhan. Most Muslims went about their lunch hour as they would any other month of the year. Non-Muslims had a difficult time understanding when I described to them that I couldn’t eat because I was fasting. They would usually say “but Ahmed is Muslim and he eats lunch.  ” This confused a lot of the non-Muslims, and I never had the courage to ask Ahmed why he didn’t fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At work there was much curiosity about my daily routine during the month of Ramadhan. I remember having someone ask if I came from the same religion as the men who wear turbans (the Sikhs). Describing to them the practices of Islam was extremely difficult. To my surprise my co-workers were tremendously supportive and understanding of our differences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weather in Calgary can make fasting extremely easy or exceptionally difficult. When Ramadhan occurs during the winter months the days are short and the low temperatures allow for a fairly easy fast. However during the summer months, the heat and the long days make for a more challenging experience. The challenging days make breaking the fast all the more exciting and those are the days I feel the most thankful. The difficult days are the ones that make me stronger. Those are the days I feel the most connected to other Muslims, feeling like we all share common goals and experiences. One sister shared her experience of going to the mosque for Tarawih, and finding so many people there that many men had to pray in the parking lot, in the cold. This is the month that really brings Muslims in Calgary together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than bringing Muslim Calgarians together, Ramadhan also brings my family closer. During this month my family’s dynamic is altered. We are friendlier to each other; we also tend to do things together. My family reschedules its daily routine so that all of us can be together to break our fast. I feel more like a better version of myself during this month.  It truly is my favourite month of the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333399;">Ramadhan On The Corniche </span></h2>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #999999;">Ramadhan can evoke nostalgia and memories of family now far away. But as Uzma Adnan learnt in her new home in Jeddah, it also offers a great compensatory package!</span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
During my first year in Saudi Arabia, by the time Ramadhan rolled along, I was acutely depressed. And the onset of the holy month made me even more so – I missed my family. In Jeddah, it was just my husband and me. Though I loved preparing food for him, I found iftar to be the loneliest time and I missed my family sorely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Back home, Ramadhan was a quiet time when families spent their evenings together and slept early so they could wake up early the next day. Only during the last third of the month did things pick up when preparations for Eid would be in full swing: visits to the tailor for Eid outfits and shopping for Eid gifts – all the frenzy culminating in “chaand raat” (night before Eid) when younger members of the family would celebrate by going out for a drive to popular shopping arenas (and get stuck in traffic for hours), and girls would buy bangles to coordinate with their Eid outfits and apply henna on their palms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In Jeddah, each night of Ramadhan was like ‘chaand raat’ – an endless celebration. Most main roads were lit up with special lights, and there were banners wishing “Ramadhan Kareem” almost everywhere. Malls and amusement arcades were full, and driving along the Corniche in Jeddah it was impossible to find a parking spot because locals and expats would roll out a rug on any spot available, bring out a picnic hamper and sit by the sea for hours – sometimes not leaving until after they had had their suhur and said their prayers. Children enjoyed camel rides, rode on carousels and played endless games of tag. It was hard for me to conceive how they ever got up for school the next morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
After Tarawih prayers, my husband and I would go out to the malls to walk around or drive along the Corniche area. 2:00a.m. in Jeddah could very well be 7:00p.m. elsewhere. It wasn’t unusual to meet friends for a pre-suhur meal at 1a.m. or go grocery shopping just before Fajr. I had never seen a city so wide awake in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In Pakistan it was rare and rather unusual to have iftar at a restaurant; we always stayed home and ate with our families. But in Jeddah, not only did every restaurant chain have special Ramadhan offers, but there were offers on suhur too… And though we didn’t have suhur at restaurants, we often picked up fragrant, freshly made Foul Medammas, Mutabbaq (a kind of omelette) and pitas on our way back home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a part of congregational prayers here in Saudi, was also a strangely wonderful experience. Never before had I experienced praying in a mosque, and never before had I been swayed by emotions as strong as the ones I felt standing there – one amongst dozens present in a beautiful white mosque that seems to float over the Red Sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
During <em>qiyam-al-layl</em> (when we complete the Qur’an in the last ten nights), there wouldn’t be one dry eye around me as the Imam’s voice would break with emotion when he uttered supplications. I could not understand a single word, but I felt his passion and that of all those around me and it made me feel for the first time that I wasn’t alone&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I yearn for Ramadhan when it’s over. It renews my faith and energises me for the next year to come. Somehow, the daily routine makes me feel like I’m in a safe cocoon – and when it’s all over, I’m plunging head-on into whirling confusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333399;">From A Distance </span></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #999999;">Juli Herman can still sense the smells and tastes of the Malaysian Ramadhan Bazaar, even from across the ocean! </span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
“Two Ayam Percik!” Already, I hear orders for the famous grilled chicken continually basted to a glistening shine with a spicy, creamy sauce. Voices can be heard over the monotonous drone of the generators. The welcoming din of the Ramadhan Bazaar embraces me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sea of people throng the many aisles formed by arrays of stalls, filling the parking lot and side streets normally teeming with traffic during normal hours. I brace myself as I plunge into the crowd, weaving my way through, trying not to bump into anyone.<br />
Suddenly, I smell a nutty aroma, and turn my head towards it. An Apam Balik stall greets me. The seller skillfully ladles the batter into molds and covers them. At just the right moment, he slathers creamy corn on the half done crepes, and tops them with chopped peanuts. Once done, the hot crispy crepes are folded in half. I open my mouth to order, but noticing the standing crowd, I decide to forage for something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The deeper in I venture, the steamier it gets. I pass by a stall with hissing and sizzling woks, deliciously tossed with oodles of noodles, squids, shrimps, bean sprouts, and fish balls. It’s little wonder it feels like a sauna! The drink stall displaying plastic barrels sloshing with drinks becomes my next stop. I eagerly watch as my order of pastel pink Sirap Bandung is ladled into a plastic bag, then deftly tied at the top with string.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahh… I do miss the joys and toils of a Ramadhan bazaar. It has been eleven years since I last spent Ramadhan in Malaysia. I miss the abundance of culinary pleasures readily available there. Sometimes I pine for traditional Malaysian desserts that my unskilled fingers refuse to recreate perfectly. In the wintry Ramadhans, when there is no pressing need for thirst-quenching drinks at Iftar, I couldn’t help but yearn for the cold drinks that are the most sought after fast-breakers in Malaysia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How I wish I could skip the cooking and indulge in bazaar food, especially when I can barely find enough time to read the Qur’an amidst the chaos and demands three children and a baby produce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Ramadhan in the United States is a completely different experience, both physically and spiritually. Though I was rather homesick in the beginning, I have learned to enjoy living in a multicultural Muslim community. Having iftar with my international Muslim sisters has broadened my mindset, taste buds and in turn, has added to my repertoire of culinary skills. In addition to Malay cuisines, our kitchen is now also wonderfully suffused with the aroma of Basmati rice prepared the Somali, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is probably the deprivation of the Ramadhan bazaar that has brought about beneficial changes for me personally. Where I used to gulp down sweet, cold drinks for iftar back home, I am now content with a few sips of water. Our iftar spread is not as lavish as it is in Malaysia, but it is more than enough to satisfy our hunger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is in the absence of easy access to familiar, abundant, and extravagant delicacies that I have learned to appreciate the true essence of fasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
And, though I can still hear “Two Ayam Percik!” being lauded in an atmosphere I do at times crave to be in, I can also hear my heart telling me “It’s all good.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ann (Umameer) Stock finds that with much du’a, dreams of studying Qur’an abroad came through for one tenacious sister.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Umm Ayyoub was born into a Muslim family but woke up to her religion when she entered university. Prior to that, she thoughtlessly went through the motions of being a Muslim. She had attended Qur’an memorisation lessons, yet she found herself struggling to even read Surah An-Nas properly. Refusing to accept her situation, Umm Ayyoub decided she wanted to turn her life around.  She began to study about Islam in detail, though her family didn’t see why. When her father passed away, it was a turning point.  They needed her knowledge to cope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She continually made du’a to Allah to open her doors for learning perhaps travelling abroad and studying at Um Al Qura University in Mecca. After years of du’a, Allah (SWT) was about to deliver His plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A young man came to her family interested in marriage. Umm Ayyoub by this time had finished teacher training and was doing on-the-job training. She had clear cut goals: “I had certain boxes that had to be ticked,” said Umm Ayyoub “and they were almost all Islamic-based.” The young man sat quietly while Umm Ayyoub outlined her plans for studying. At that point she wanted to study everything: Qur’an, fiqh, aqeedah. After she finished her presentation, he didn’t ask any questions and left. She wondered if that was good sign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She prayed Salat Al-Istikharah, asking Allah (SWT) for whatever was best. The young man later told Umm Ayyoub that he didn’t ask questions because he liked everything he had heard. After she accepted his proposal, he was offered jobs abroad and asked her to choose from them. She chose Saudi Arabia. To this day he continues his unwavering support. May Allah (SWT) reward him for each and every letter she learns and teaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to marriage, Umm Ayyoub had never been away from her close-knit family. In Jeddah she was alone without friends. Everything was strange. She didn’t know her way around, and Saudi was not the Islamic Utopia she was expecting. She cried a lot at first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her biggest mistakes were not finding a support group straight away or investigating options for studying in Jeddah. Um Al Qura in Makkah proved to be too far away. “The first year was experimental,” she says. Eventually she found Dar El Huda, an excellent tajweed school with a section for non-Arab women. She went from two nights a week to intensive daytime studies the following year. It changed her life. She will be attending level 4 next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning tajweed is hard work but her recitation has completely improved. She has also completed a course in Qaa’idah an-Nooraaniyyah (an Arabic reading proficiency technique) and due to her high marks, will join their training program for teachers. She aspires to get her ijaza for the memorisation of the Jazariyyah (a lengthy Arabic poem containing all of the tajweed rules) and memorising the entire Qur’an.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focusing on Qur’an instead of several different areas of study was what she did right. “Qur’an is our main source of guidance, focusing on it has been one of the best things I have ever done,” says Umm Ayyoub.  Also, she discovered that studying while single was easier than after marriage. But it was also easier with a new baby rather than being pregnant and constantly feeling sick. “You never get more time you only get less,” says Um Ayoub, “so don’t delay!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) answered her du’a beyond her dreams. She has a supportive husband and like-minded supportive friends. Umm Ayyoub feels that she has a responsibility to return to England and spread the knowledge to her community. “It wouldn’t be right if I just stayed home and kept this all to myself. Allah would ask me why I hadn’t shared my gift.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em><span style="color: #999999;">Ann (Umameer) Stock reverted to Islam 27 years ago and lives back and forth between Cairo and Jeddah with her Egyptian husband. The Middle East has been home for over 24 years. She has seven children and eight grandchildren &#8211;  Alhamdulillah.</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just as a crown is the final touch in a king&#8217;s ensemble, dips and chutneys enhance and complete food, be they main meals or snacks. French fries, samosas, roast chicken, curries &#8211; all require that special condiment to enrich the taste and make the meal whole. Here I present a variety of dips to suit every palate, ranging from the very spicy to those on the mild side, from the sweet to the tangy and sour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: All chutneys must be stored in a glass jar in the fridge and served cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Green Chutney</strong></span><br />
Try this chutney in Ramadhan with samosas and turnovers. For a sweet version, pour some in a bowl and mix some tomato sauce into it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Creative Motivations’ Ke’lona Hamilton discusses the importance of family traditions and gives inspiration for creating your o]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wonderful month of Ramadhan is now approaching. For children and adults alike, this can be a much-needed time to grow spiritually and become closer as a family. For individuals who have been raised Muslim, many family traditions may be passed on and practised year after year. However, for converts, or individuals who are just beginning to practise their faith, this can mean developing a whole new set of traditions, as well as the abandonment of many of the celebrations (such as birthdays or Christmas) that we may have grown up with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Growing up as a non-Muslim, I had fond memories of the holidays. We were not a religious family, and we were not a wealthy family, so we would often focus upon family-togetherness, gratitude and love during these special times. Whether it was decorating with handmade trinkets, the taste of my grandmother’s turkey dressing or the fresh scent of pine needles, these memories still warm my heart – even today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when I converted to Islam and began to have children of my own, I knew that many of the traditions that I had so loved as a child would not be carried on. The years passed, and a few Ramadhans and ‘Eids went by, but something was clearly missing. I realised that it was time to create new family traditions so that my children could have the same heart-warming memories that I cherished from my own childhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For families living in non-Muslim lands, it can be especially difficult to compensate for the countless non-Islamic holidays practised around us. Making Ramadhan and the two ‘Eids special, and filling them with traditions that the family can look forward to, can really help fill in the gaps and ensure that children do not feel disheartened by the non-Muslim festivities around them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, here are a few traditions and ideas from our family to yours. I hope they will inspire you to find creative ways to make your next Ramadhan one to remember&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ab7903;"><strong>RAMADHAN TRADITIONS TO:</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ab7903;"><strong>Get into the spirit</strong></span></p>
<p>• Begin fasting in the month before Ramadhan. Try to include the whole family. This will make transitioning into full-time fasting much easier.</p>
<p>• Create a Ramadhan Countdown Calendar to heighten the excitement and help everyone prepare for the fast.</p>
<p>• Before Ramadhan begins, discuss each family member’s goals for the month and explore ways to help one another achieve those goals.</p>
<p>• Decorate the house as a family. Something as simple as paper rings, stars and lanterns can really spruce up the home and offers an excellent opportunity to bond with the family. You can also decorate the outside of the house to show that this is your family&#8217;s time to celebrate. Try having the kids decorate a sign to hang on your door announcing that it&#8217;s the holy month.</p>
<p>• Decrease TV time, and create a special Ramadhan Reading Space. Decorate the area with floor pillows and a small bookshelf and put lots of age-appropriate Islamic books on the shelf that will appeal to everyone in the household.</p>
<p>• Ramadhan is a time of renewal. Clean the whole house, and have the children go through clothes, toys and books, and set aside items that they don’t want or use anymore. Have a garage sale, and donate the funds to charity or donate the items to a local charitable organisation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ab7903;"><strong>Strengthen the bonds</strong></span></p>
<p>• Have younger children fast from candy/sweets, so that they feel included too!</p>
<p>• Get together as a family when Ramadhan is expected to begin, and attempt to sight the moon.</p>
<p>• Make suhoor extra special by serving smoothies or pastries that are normally reserved as treats.</p>
<p>•  Make a Ramadhan scrap book (online as a photo album/blog or a real one with arts and crafts supplies) taking photos of the moon each night, gifts and meals shared, fun activities, etc.</p>
<p>• Spend some time outdoors, even if it&#8217;s only in your own backyard. Use this opportunity to talk to the kids about the moon cycles, or just relish the beauty of nature.</p>
<p>• The family that prays together stays together! Go to the masjid as a family to pray Taraweeh prayers, and pray them at home as a family as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ab7903;"><strong>Strengthen the faith</strong></span></p>
<p>• Make a &#8220;Gratitude Jar.&#8221; Decorate a jar, then think of 30 things you or your family may be grateful for. Write these ideas on scraps of paper; you could write serious or silly things (for example, I am grateful for sunshine/ the great art the kids make me/our home/ being Muslim, etc) and add an activity to each one that celebrates that gratitude (for sunshine it might be to spend a day at the beach. For kids’ art it might be paint a picture together, etc). Pull one gratitude/activity from the jar each day and talk about why you’re grateful for it and do the activity together.<br />
• In addition to Qur’an, play permissible nasheeds around the house to keep everyone distracted from the difficulty of the fast.</p>
<p>• Have the children work as a team to memorise a new surah of the Qur’an. Reward them if they are able to complete it.</p>
<p>• If you don’t do this regularly, have the children (and yourself) recite the three Quls and make du’a each night before bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ab7903;"><strong>Increase in charity</strong></span></p>
<p>• Allow each child to decorate their own Sadaqah Jar, and then give them opportunities to earn money throughout the month to fill it. Reward the child who earns the most with a special badge or the choice of where you’ll eat for ‘Eid breakfast.</p>
<p>• To pay Zakat-ul-Fitr, have the kids help put together a food box, then leave it anonymously on the doorstep of a needy family early before the ‘Eid prayer.</p>
<p>• Volunteer at a local organisation as a family. Seeing others in need and joining together as a family to help your community, reinforces the ideas that are central to the month of Ramadhan.</p>
<p>• Buy to-go trays and have your children help you make food plates. Check with your masjid for free dawah pamphlets and tape them on top of the trays and pass them out to local homeless people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ab7903;"><strong>Share the love</strong></span></p>
<p>• Invite family and friends over for iftar, and prepare the meal as a family. There is tremendous reward in feeding the fasting person when it’s time to break their fast. This also helps extend your Ramadhan traditions and festivities to the whole community.</p>
<p>• Can&#8217;t get to see all of your extended family? Make a video blog! Make a short recording each day of Ramadhan, talking about the difficulty or ease of the fast, family activities, childhood memories, reflections on the prayer or Qur’an you&#8217;ve read that day. Post the video clips on a Blog and invite your family members to subscribe or post videos of their own.</p>
<p>• Have the kids help bake cookies, put them in decorative bags, and give them to neighbours with an explanation of the month of Ramadhan and the importance of kindness to one&#8217;s neighbours in Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few family traditions to consider for this Ramadhan and for those to come. Find traditions that work well for your family and try them this year. Before you know it, they will become long-standing traditions in your home that will make every Ramadhan a Ramadhan to remember, insha Allah!</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sara was deep in thought as she chopped up vegetables &#8211; it was day 15 of Ramadhan &#8211; surely now would be an OK time, wouldn&#8217;t it? Two weeks of Ramadhan, plus the whole month of Shaban leading up to it, that would make it over six weeks without any intimacy, so tonight would be acceptable wouldn’t it? Surely tonight she could show him how much she had missed him, and Khalid would agree, wouldn’t he? Maybe after taraweeh he would be more in the mood? Or was after iftar better?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sara went through various dialogues in her head as she prepared the meat; should she wear something nice? Or maybe apply her new lip gloss and perfume in the hope he&#8217;d notice? Or should she surprise him with a kiss? Too late &#8211; he was here. Sara spun round as Khalid walked into the kitchen, sniffing the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Mmm. What&#8217;s for iftar today?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She smiled to herself and put a hand on his chest, “How about what&#8217;s for after iftar?” she teased. His look stopped her, a disapproving frown that made her flinch. Her voice faltered, “I mean, yes, it’s the usual reading of course after iftar.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She turned away, stung and furious with herself for even trying. Why had she even bothered? Why put herself through the humiliation of rejection. Of course he wouldn’t be interested. He was too focused on his ‘ibadah. What was she even thinking? She should have been equally focused, if not even more. So why was she the only one missing their physical closeness?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Sara was experiencing isn&#8217;t an uncommon occurrence; it&#8217;s just not a widely discussed one. Rejection by one&#8217;s spouse due to overzealousness and religious abstinence during and outside of Ramadhan? Yes, it really does happen. Spouses will forego the desires of life to reach spiritual highs. They go to the extreme of giving up the halal pleasures of life in their misconstrued belief that they can get even closer to Allah (SWT) by shunning &#8216;distractions&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This level of &#8216;piety&#8217; can have the opposite devastating effect on the spouse; the neglect impacts on many levels &#8211; mental, physical and religious perception. When you are made to feel rejected and unwanted, how you can even begin to speak up about what you desire?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It eats away at a person, even more so if the neglect is due to religious zeal, because how can you possibly argue against a point of piety? It isn’t easy to say to your spouse to ”stop being so practising.” Sounds pitiful in the greater scheme of understanding, because who doesn’t want to be closer to Allah (SWT), and now you can’t possibly resent your spouse because they’re trying to be pious, can you? What Muslim in their right mind is going to resent a &#8216;religious&#8217; person? And yet that&#8217;s precisely what happens, behind so many closed doors of the pious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The husband or wife cannot freely express their desire for fear of being rejected on the basis of religious grounds with such reasons as “We need to concentrate more on our ‘ibadah” or “We need to make more time for spiritual growth, don’t waste it on the pleasures of life.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the &#8216;pious&#8217; spouse, yes there is hard logic to their never ending acts of ‘ibadah &#8211; if you look at in a black and white context &#8211; but what are they actually giving up? Halal pleasure, halal intercourse! Doesn’t he acknowledge that such pleasure is allowed? He wants to neglect that because he feels it is going to distract him! What is this mad notion that the pleasures of intercourse and physical desires will detract from spirituality. Do these men and women not know that they stand to gain rewards from engaging in such an act?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah&#8217;s Messenger (SAW) said: &#8220;In the sexual act of each of you there is a sadaqah.&#8221; The Companions replied: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! When one of us fulfils his sexual desire, will he be given a reward for that?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Do you not think that were he to act upon it unlawfully, he would be sinning? Likewise, if he acts upon it lawfully he will be rewarded.&#8221;<span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Muslim)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do spouses risk eliciting feelings of neglect and bitterness towards them for their own misconception of attaining reward? Why turn something that is halal for you into something that is forbidden? Why didn’t you just declare abstinence and declare yourself a monk in that case? Why, because you are human and you have basic human needs that have to be met. One such need is physical desire, and there is the need to be loved and wanted. To shut out such needs is denying the body a basic right, akin to rest and satiation of hunger. You cannot do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following well known incident reiterates this point perfectly. The Prophet made a bond of brotherhood between Salman and Abu Ad-Darda’. Salman paid a visit to Abu Ad-Darda&#8217; and found Um Ad-Darda&#8217; dressed in shabby clothes and asked her why she was in that state. She replied, &#8220;Your brother Abu Ad-Darda&#8217; is not interested in (the luxuries of) this world. Salman told Abu Ad-Darda&#8217;, &#8220;Your Lord has a right on you, your soul has a right on you, and your family has a right on you; so you should give the rights of all those who has a right on you.&#8221; Abu Ad-Darda&#8217; came to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. The Prophet said, &#8220;Salman has spoken the truth.&#8221;<span style="color: #999999;"> <em>(Sahih Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a verse which specifically places emphasis on how the act of love and intercourse should be. Note how it brings up the point of being able to freely have intercourse during the nights of fasting, as reassurance that fasting does not include undue hardship; it complements a natural way of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #b80202;"><strong>It is made lawful for you, in the nights of fast, to have intercourse with your women. They are a cover for you and you are a cover for them.</strong> </span><span style="color: #999999;">(Al Baqarah:187)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though this issue is a delicate one, the key is knowledge and understanding moderation in ‘ibadah, such that it doesn’t border on taking away one’s own, or another’s, basic rights. As for addressing the actual problem, open communication and the confidence to share your innermost desires and needs, at the risk of being rejected, needs to be employed so that your spouse at the very least knows how you are feeling, even if they don’t agree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SISTERS’ columnist and Wives of Jannah founder Megan Wyatt offers some advice as to how to tackle such an issue effectively:<br />
“If you are dealing with a spouse who seems to become an entirely different person during Ramadhan, it&#8217;s important to first understand and recognise their good intentions. While sex itself can be a part of worship, many men make a connection that sex, sexual thought, urges, desires and all forms of sexual need is a sign of their weakness. This may reflect their own daily struggles to grasp with sexuality in a healthy way, so as a result, they end up taking a &#8220;cold turkey&#8221; approach to all of it, even with their spouse, in order to become more focused in Ramadhan. Some men are afraid that if they show desire for their wife, or give into desire with her, they won&#8217;t be as focused on matters that they have neglected in other parts of the year, such as praying ‘Isha at the masjid, reading more Qur&#8217;an, or praying consistent tahajjud. (And this same scenario also occurs in some marriages outside of Ramadhan)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wife in this situation, after placing in her heart appreciation for his intention, must confidently know that she isn&#8217;t a negative distraction because she has sexual desires. In fact, being intimate regularly in this blessed month, combined with the extra acts of worship her husband is engaging in, is an opportunity to live in true balance as a Muslim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Piety within Islam is a life lived in balance. When she invites him to be intimate, and he responds negatively, she should focus on his fear of being taken away from Allah, not by her, but by his own personal weaknesses and increase in compassion. Her loving insistence that&#8217;s it&#8217;s OK for them to be intimate invites him to explore, more deeply, how he can stay connected to Allah, at all times and that is his personal challenge to manage. Not hers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You aren&#8217;t a less pious Muslim for desiring your husband during Ramadhan or any other time of the year, and it&#8217;s important you know that, so that no matter his response, you understand his refusal or struggle to be with you reflects his struggle, and it has nothing to do with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key point to remember is balance. Piety is an internal equilibrium of compassion, understanding and application within limitations. Islam is a very balanced religion that complements human nature. One cannot overcome the religion; rather, it will overcome you because the deen has been completed. It is not in need of extreme abstinence; you are in more need of your basic necessities than a temporary spiritual high. No one can be more perfect in deen and character than the Prophet r, and if he himself pointed out that he eats, sleeps and goes to his wives, then what scope is there to add further piety than his.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="color: #f09559;">It is important for family members to create a more inclusive environment for those that cannot fast during Ramadhan. They must try to help those that cannot fast to not feel excluded and instead also have an enriched Ramadhan experience.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramadhan is the month where many of us are eager to fast and appreciate whatever provisions we have. It is where we focus on how we can give back and spiritually grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are eager to fast to have the full-on Ramadhan experience where we not only cultivate our souls but also our bodies. We not only try to grow ourselves but also grow with other Muslims around us who are also fasting in order to have a more enriched Ramadhan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are, however, some who are unable to fast at all due to the health challenges that they face or frailness due to age. They are advised not to fast due to the toll it would have on their bodies, but many of them start to feel left out and excluded from the whole Ramadhan experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore important for family members to create a more inclusive environment for those that cannot fast during Ramadhan. They must try to help those that cannot fast to not feel excluded and instead also have an enriched Ramadhan experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were times where I could not fast during Ramadhan due to my life with physical ‘disabilities.’[1] Initially, I easily felt excluded. However, there were ways in which my family made me feel like I was involved and actually taking part in the Ramadhan experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, I hope to share ways in which family members could foster a more inclusive Ramadhan:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #f09559;">1. The encouragement to have the intention to fast</span></strong><br />
I was unable to fast but my mother still encouraged me to have the intention to fast with the hope that Allah (SWT) would accept it. She explained how those that have to fast first had to have the intention to fast &#8211; Allah (SWT) rewards them according to their intention even before doing the act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said, “Verily, Allah recorded the good deeds and the evil deeds. Then He clarified how that [recording] should occur: whoever decided to do a good deed but he did not do it, Allah records it with Him as a complete good deed. And if he decided to do it and actually did it, Allah records it with Him as ten good deeds up to seven hundred or up to many times over. If he decided to do an evil deed but he did not do it, Allah records it with Him as one complete good deed. If he decided to do it and he actually did it, Allah records it as one evil deed.” <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Bukhari)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mother therefore encouraged me to have the intention to fast and explained how Allah (SWT) might increase my reward due to me wanting to fast even though not being able to. It is Allah (SWT) who only knows the extent we will be rewarded, but the main focus should be on having pure intentions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus was therefore not on the physical act of fasting but rather the spiritual act of fasting &#8211; I had to shift my mindset. I had to make sure that I did everything with pure intentions and make sure that I used my time wisely as if I was someone who was fasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thus made to mentally prepare myself with the plan and focus on how to grow and make good use of Ramadhan &#8211; for example, doing extra good deeds and spending extra time learning, especially since I could not fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #f09559;">2. Involvement during suhoor and iftar</span></strong><br />
I was not only encouraged to have the intention to fast but also attend the suhoor and iftar with my family. I was made to wake up and join my family in the morning as well as the evening. The act of joining my family to start and break the fast made me feel like I was part of the Ramadhan experience. It made me feel like I was fasting, especially after having made the intention to fast. It made me feel included and I especially felt involved when I helped prepare food and serve drinks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #f09559;">3. Assigning leadership roles in family religious activities</span></strong><br />
I had the task to encourage my younger brothers to read the Qur’an, do nightly dhikr and share whatever I had learnt after listening to lectures. This all would be done in my room so I was not only made to feel included but also responsible. I was made to feel important and useful in their Ramadhan experience. This in return gave me a more fulfilled and enriched Ramadhan experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #f09559;">4. Encouragement of contributing to society</span></strong><br />
My parents did not only make me feel useful at home but also in society by encouraging me to give charity from my own pocket money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Ramadhan makes us grateful for what we have and see how we could help those that may be going through trials of poverty. My parents explained to me that it was not necessary to actually fast for us to understand these lessons and values. Fasting can help us discover these values but there are still other ways to learn and understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We can still contribute and be involved; for example, I was invited to give talks abroad and my mother encouraged me to contribute to society in the form of classes within my community. By doing this, it meant I was able to give back by sharing what I know, and experience Ramadhan with those around me. I was part of someone’s Ramadhan experience while having them be part of mine, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
These four ways of being involved I have mentioned demonstrates how it is possible to have an inclusive Ramadhan, despite not being able to fast. It shows how it is the responsibility of family members to include and encourage those that cannot fast so that they can find hope &#8211; to know they are not necessarily missing out on the Ramadhan experience because they are unable to fast. By encouraging this involvement, people who are unable to fast will still feel they are just as much Muslim as everyone else and not anything less. It will help them focus on striving to reach their maximum potential instead of causing them to feel left out for not being able to fast. Feeling useful, important and involved would therefore pave the way to a more inclusive, fulfilling, and enriched Ramadhan &#8211; not only for them but for those around them.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Wondering how to encourage your little ones to fast this Ramadhan? Raeesa Patel shares some great tips.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, Ramadhan in South Africa falls smack in the middle of a winter that promises to be icy. Alhamdulillah, the fasting hours are short but the bitterly cold kitchen during suhoor will sure be a test! Whilst preparing suhoor, my habit is to switch on the Channel Islam International radio station to break the silence of the night. There is one programme that never fails to brighten my mood: the radio presenter makes phone calls to homes where there are young children awake at that hour. He chats to these innocents about their Ramadhan, their fasting progress, their suhoor menu and their favourite iftar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as I drink my tea and smile at the little ones’ comments, I say a silent prayer for those parents that got it right and instilled in their mini-Muslims the will to fast and the love of doing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of us with babies and toddlers, it is best to begin preparing our children from an early age so that when the time comes, our kiddos are ready to fast with gusto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Celebrate Ramadhan and be happy </span></strong><br />
• Do all that you can to make Ramadhan a special and memorable time for your family; make it the time of year that everyone looks forward to.<br />
• Involve your children from the word go. Give them responsibilities for the month that play a part in ensuring the smooth functioning of the home.<br />
• Have a family meeting before Ramadhan and explain the significance of this month. Tell them the story of the Battle of Badr and impress upon them the absolute faith those 300 warriors had.<br />
• Teach them about the goodness of this month and how much mercy Allah (SWT) has for us during these days.<br />
• Go out and look for the moon together. Whoever sights it first and remembers to read the du’a wins a prize.<br />
• Invite their friends over for iftar or suhoor and cook all the junk food “meals” that would make any sane adult shudder.<br />
• Just do everything in your power to create a lasting love affair between your child and this beautiful month of fasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Teach your children the purpose of fasting</strong></span><br />
Children are innately curious and their minds need to question every answer until all the answers can link up, create a pattern and make sense. So help them make sense out of Ramadhan:<br />
• Make up stories that will explain the beautiful logic that exists behind fasting<br />
• Read books to them that will bring the purpose of Ramadhan alive<br />
• Sing nasheeds that are centred around the sighting of the moon, good deeds and Ramadhan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<em>Ramadhan</em>, by Suhaib Hamid Ghazi<br />
<em>My First Ramadhan</em>, by Karen Katz<br />
<em>Celebrating Ramadhan</em>, by Diane Hoyt-Goldsmith<br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Ramadhan Nasheeds:</span></em></strong><br />
<em>Ramadhan Song</em> with Zaky<br />
<em>Welcome Oh Ramadhan</em> – Zain Bikha<br />
<em>So We’ve Scanned the Sky</em> – Dawud Wharnsby</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Be wise and improvise</strong></span><br />
Once a Muslim removes food from the equation, we realise just how much of our day is eaten up (pun intended!) by meal times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Fasting children will realise this too and, as any mother will tell you, children with too much idle time on their hands are a sure fire recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Be prepared to battle boredom by ensuring that your cupboards are well-stocked with board games, colouring pencils, colouring books, paints, play dough and whatever else will attract your child’s interest. If the weather is accommodating, send them outside to count the bugs or to collect butterflies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Remember that a bored child can almost surely drive a parent to distraction but a bored AND hungry child may very well drive you nuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong><em>Kiddy Krafts for Ramadhan:   </em> </strong></span><br />
• Create beautiful ‘Eid cards for friends and family.<br />
• Print out black and whites images of masajid around the world and let your children colour them in.<br />
• Have an “international iftar” where the family cooks a cosmopolitan meal together.<br />
• Make a Ramadhan scrapbook filled with photos and pictures of what this year’s Ramadhan represents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Praise and applaud</strong></span><br />
Let your little ones know that every effort they make is noticed. Gradually encourage your children to begin fasting in whatever way works best for them: some parents allow their young children to fast for half a day whilst others allow their child to break the fast at lunch, refuel and fast again until iftar. Other parents fear these methods as they feel it teaches the child to take fasting lightly and so decide that the child should either fast or not fast so as to emphasise the importance of the act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whichever method works for your little ones, stick to it and reward them for every fast kept. Acknowledge all of their accomplishments during this month and encourage good behaviour by explaining that Allah (SWT) Himself rewards us tenfold for regular good behaviour while we are fasting!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Keep track of your child’s fast by creating a day by day calendar that can be stuck up on the wall or on the fridge. Make it eye catching and exciting. For every fast kept, let your child stick the date pit with which he or she broke his or her fast onto the relevant day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Serve others</span></strong><br />
What would this month be without helping others? With the help of your children, begin a soup kitchen or tin food drive for those who are in need. Try to take them to places that serve children so that they can see that there are young people out there who are not as fortunate as they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Inculcate a love for society and for community by encouraging them to think of ways to be of service to people in their neighbourhood. Help them to develop and implement these ideas and let them know that Allah (SWT) loves those who help others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Get it right</strong></span><br />
Teaching our children to fast from childhood establishes the routine in their lives and prepares them for the annual fasting month. So when fasting becomes obligatory upon them, their bodies, minds and spirits are no stranger to the concept of abstinence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As I read the du’a for fasting, the voices over the radio &#8211; some bright and chirpy and others sleepy and slurred  &#8211; inspire me to be the best fasting Muslim I can be for that day. Because if our tiny ones can do it, then so can we.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Fahima Miah takes us along on her Umrah for Ramadhan.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SubhanAllah, in 2011 I was blessed with the opportunity to perform Umrah again, this time during the sacred month of Ramadhan! Umrah is an amazing experience, and for anyone considering going, I would sincerely encourage going for it in Ramadhan! Contrary to expectations, performing Umrah during Ramadhan was a totally different and heightened experience altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I was completely dumbfounded. Before, whilst watching pilgrims praying their salah in the Haram, I would be baffled as to why people would opt to pray outside of the Haram as oppose to as close to the Ka&#8217;bah as possible. Now I understood. As it was Ramadhan, swarms of people had made their way to the two holy cities seeking rewards from Allah (SWT) likely knowing that it had been narrated that the Prophet (SAW) said “When the month of Ramadan arrives, go for ‘umrah, because `umrah in Ramadan is like accompanying me on Hajj.” <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Bukhârî)  </span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One vivid memory I carry is that of performing the Sa&#8217;ee between Safa and Marwa. I was beyond thirsty and my Dad was searching for a functioning Zamzam tap in the middle of the two walkways. Understandably the taps had been switched off during the fasting hours, but we just wanted to splash water on ourselves for some relief. This was quite amazing in itself. No access to water made for a more literal re-tracing of the steps that Hajar (RA) took while desperately searching for water for the prophet Isma&#8217;il (AS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I better remembered that whenever I felt some sort of coolness or mysterious spray of water, that this was Allah&#8217;s (SWT) mercy. I was also more thankful than I had ever been for the rainy weather we are accustomed to in Britain. Alhamdulillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During iftar time in Medina, my sister and I had brought little food with us besides dates and were seated on a prayer mat above the burning hot floor outside of the mosque of the beloved Rasool (SAW). Although in both of the holy mosques, each and every day there were people distributing bread, yogurt, cups of Zamzam, dates and more, I especially remember a beautiful family that had settled themselves on a large, thick, prayer mat sharing food and drink with each other a couple of centimetres away from us. The beautiful thing about this family was that they were so loving and generous that, by the will of Allah (SWT), they made a plate for us, consisting of chickpeas, salad and pilau rice. Not only did they offer us delicious food, but after the men in the family had moved, we were invited to pray with the sisters on their prayer mat. May Allah (SWT) reward this family, and all of the other generous Muslims we encountered, for their kindness, insha Allah. The sheer amount of generosity of food put into perspective the true unity in this Ummah, and how it breaks the barriers of language and race just to stand side by side to worship our Creator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, this Ramadhan will always have a special place in my heart. Sharing my experience with you right now has opened the gate to many good memories. I pray that I return soon, insha Allah, and that I have been able to reveal even a glimpse of this amazing time which I encourage you all to try to attain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Prophet (SAW) said: “When one of you is fasting, he should break his fast with dates; but if he cannot get any, then (he should break his fast) with water, for water is purifying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Do you serve dates on your Ramadhan iftar table or make it a point to break your fast with them? If yes, you’re like countless other Muslims around the world who have adopted this sunnah as a personal food tradition of their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Dates are not only associated with Ramadhan, however. The fruit is favoured by many Muslims for tahneek, the sunnah of rubbing something sweet into the mouth of a newborn. They are mentioned more than twenty times in the holy Qur’an – including a mention that they will be a food of Paradise – and numerous ahadith provide evidence that they were an important food among the Arabs and early Muslims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
Let’s look then, at some interesting facts and nutritional information about this naturally sweet and incredibly popular food:</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>• Dates are the fruit of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) tree, which is most widely cultivated in the Middle East, North Africa, Central Africa and Southern Asia and Southeast Asia.<br />
• More than 40 varieties of dates are grown in Arabia alone. Depending on variety, dates may be harvested soft, dry or semi-dry.<br />
• Dates have been consumed for at least 7,000 years and appear to have been cultivated for more than two thousand.<br />
• Date seeds can lie dormant for years or even decades when germinating conditions are unfavourable.<br />
• Dates are high in sugar, protein and (when fresh) Vitamin C. They also contain potassium, magnesium, iron, fibre, fat and<br />
carbohydrates.<br />
• Dates are easily digested, making them a quick source of energy and nutrients.<br />
• Eating dates at iftar can help your body’s blood glucose levels quickly return to normal.<br />
• Consumption of dates will satisfy the sensation of hunger, which in turn helps avoid overeating.<br />
• Dates can be beneficial in treating constipation, diarrhea and intestinal disorders, and they can help promote a healthy heart. They also help to increase sexual stamina and are believed to be valuable in the prevention and treatment of abdominal cancer.<br />
• Dates aren’t just for people; Arabs in the Sahara are known to use dates as feed for camels, horses and dogs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Ramadhan, consider using dates in cakes, cookies, fruit smoothies and more. The recipes below are just some of the countless ways this blessed fruit can be incorporated into your diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Dried Fruit and Avocado Milkshake</strong></span><br />
This healthy milkshake is made with dried figs, raisins, dates and avocado. Vary the fruits to suit your own palate.<br />
• 1 litre (1 quart) cold milk<br />
• 1 small avocado, peeled and pitted<br />
• 5 or 6 soft dried figs<br />
• 5 or 6 soft dates, pitted<br />
• handful of seedless raisins<br />
• 3 tbsp sugar or honey, or to taste<br />
• ice (optional)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a blender, combine the avocado and dried fruit with about half of the milk. Blend until the fruit has been well-processed. Add the remaining milk and sugar and blend to mix well.</p>
<p>For a well-chilled shake, blend in the optional ice cubes until they are crushed. Serve immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Moroccan Stuffed Dates</strong></span><br />
These traditional Moroccan sweets are made by stuffing dates with homemade almond paste. Easy, delicious and pretty!<br />
• 500g (1 lb.) semi-dry dates (such as Deglet Noors)<br />
• 150g (one heaped cup) blanched almonds<br />
• 60g (¼ cup) sugar<br />
• 1 ½ tbsp orange blossom water<br />
• 1 tbsp butter, melted<br />
• ¼ tsp cinnamon<br />
• food colour, optional<br />
• granulated sugar, optional, for garnish<br />
• walnut pieces, optional, for garnish</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>Make the Almond Paste:</em></span><br />
Grind the almonds, sugar and cinnamon in a food processor until the almonds are powdery and moist enough to pack. Add the butter and orange flower water; process again until a smooth paste forms. Remove the paste from the processor and if desired, divide and colour the paste by kneading a drop or two of food colour into each portion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em>Stuff the Dates:</em></span><br />
Roll small cylinders of almond paste the length of the dates, but only about ¹/₃ the diameter. Take a date, make a vertical cut deep enough to remove the pit, but not so deep as to cut the date in half. Discard the pit, insert some almond paste, and press the sides of the date firmly around the paste while leaving a portion of paste exposed. Repeat with the remaining dates and almond paste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #993300;">Optional Garnish Ideas:</span></em><br />
Top the exposed paste with a piece of walnut, shredded coconut or light dusting of cinnamon.</p>
<p>Roll the stuffed date in granulated sugar.</p>
<p>Score the exposed almond paste with a knife, then roll the date in sugar.</p>
<p>Store the stuffed dates in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Serve at room temperature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The month of Ramadhan comes every year, but when its arrival coincides with the peak of summer, its meaning really hits home, muse]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The throat is parched and the tummy is rumbling. It is just mid-afternoon and the sun is shining brightly, iftar still hours away. The dry mouth waters as thoughts of succulent dates, crispy gram flour fritters and chilled water flit through one’s mind. The eyes droop as lowered energy levels and fatigue beckon the afternoon siesta, and one longs to relax before ‘Asr prayer, even as one recites the Qur’an. There is no doubt about it: fasting during the long summer days can be a draining experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The word “Ramadhan” is derived from the Arabic root letters ra, meem, and dhad which give it the basic meaning of something being violently heated by the sun, or becoming intensely hot. When used in reference to a man, it implies that his feet got burnt by the ground or by stones heated by the sun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a noun, the word “ramadh” means the vehemence of the sun upon the sand, the burning of the intense heat of summer, or simply: heat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) says in the Qur’an:<br />
<em><span style="color: #e64cb2;"><strong>“Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur&#8217;an as a guide to mankind, also clear (signs) for guidance and judgment (between right and wrong). So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that month should spend it in fasting, but if anyone is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed period (should be made up) by days later. Allah desires ease for you, and desires not hardship for you (He wants you) to complete the prescribed period and to glorify Him in that He has guided you, and perchance you shall be grateful.”</strong> </span>(Al-Baqarah:185)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This verse describes the direct relationship between the month of Ramadhan and the Qur’an and its revelation, describing the Qur’an as ‘huda’ (guidance for mankind),  ‘bayyinaat’  (clear signs and proofs) and a ‘furqan’  (the criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong, and truth and falsehood).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tafsir Ibn Kathir confirms that Allah I revealed all the previous Divine Books or scripture during the month of Ramadhan. This month of fasting was also prescribed in all previous divinely revealed religions:<br />
Imam Ahmad reported from Wathilah bin Al-Asqa` that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (SAW) said, “The Suhuf (Pages) of Ibrahim were revealed during the first night of Ramadhan. The Torah was revealed during the sixth night of Ramadhan. The Injil was revealed during the thirteenth night of Ramadhan. Allah revealed the Qur&#8217;an on the twenty-fourth night of Ramadhan.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meaning of the Arabic word that Allah (SWT) uses to describe the fasting of Ramadhan &#8211; <em>siyam</em> &#8211; is based on the root letters saad, wow, meem, meaning abstinence. The prime purpose of siyam or abstinence from eating, drinking, sexual relations with one’s spouse, in addition to abhorrent and sinful actions during Ramadhan, is to achieve taqwa, or consciousness of Allah (SWT):</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #e64cb2;"><strong>“O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, even as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may attain taqwa (remain conscious of Allah).”</strong></span> (Al-Baqarah:183)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we can conclude is that fasting during the month of Ramadhan, as mentioned in the Qur’an, weaves several aspects of worship and spirituality together, namely: getting ‘heated up’ or tested in our willpower regarding abstaining from otherwise halal bodily desires; adopting taqwa by being more conscious of Allah (SWT) while fasting, and, finally, connecting more to the Qur’an whilst in this state of fasting. This can be understood in the following ways:</p>
<p><span style="color: #e64cb2;">•</span> Being commanded to observe abstinence from things that are otherwise halal, every day for thirty days, is akin to the intense heat of the sun bearing down upon stones or the earth, making them extremely hot. The fasting on thirty consecutive days tests a believer’s willpower, faith and belief, making him internally strong, rejuvenating his connection with Allah I, and ‘heating’ him up with a newly revived spirituality and a firmer faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘No pain, no gain,’ as they say. Just as the vehement heat of the blazing furnace is necessary to produce pure gold, the ‘intense heat’ of the yearly Ramadhan ritual of fasting, night prayer and Qur’an recitation, is necessary to ‘burn off’ the impurities of a believer’s sins, and polish him in order to make him shine like pure gold again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e64cb2;">•</span> By not eating or drinking  during the days of Ramadhan even when no human being is around to see, a believer becomes much more conscious of Allah (SWT) than he is during the rest of the year, when he can eat and drink halal things without any obligatory limits. This extra-high consciousness raises his level of taqwa, which inevitably dwindles during the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #e64cb2;">•</span> The revelation of all of Allah’s (SWT) Divine books of guidance during the month of Ramadhan, indicates the need for connecting to scripture during these thirty days. Reciting the Qur’an separately and in prayers throughout Ramadhan and endeavouring to understand it in order to act upon it is prescribed during this month. This is because the Qur’an can only be “huda” &#8211; a guidance for us &#8211; when it is understood with the intention of submitting to its commands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, only with the understanding of its words do the instructions, narratives, parables and injunctions in it take on the form of ‘bayyinaat’ (clear proofs or signs), resulting in the development of a ‘furqan’ or criterion within us, which allows us to clearly distinguish between truth and falsehood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when we employ this ‘furqan’, or criterion, in practical life and abstain from what Allah (SWT) has forbidden whilst simultaneously rushing forth in doing all the good that He has commanded, we are guided towards higher levels of taqwa, aware that Allah (SWT) is watching us all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is thus in Ramadhan that we come full circle, and emerge purified and exalted by its ‘furnace’ like pure gold, Allah (SWT) willing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Sadaf Farooqi is immensely grateful to Allah (SWT) that He cleanses us from sins and revives our dwindling faith by bringing the heat of Ramadhan upon us every year.</em></span></p>
