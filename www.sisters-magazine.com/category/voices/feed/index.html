		<description><![CDATA[From Safaa Baig’s debut novel we meet sixteen-year old Katie Anderson whose charismatic father just turned her charming world up]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In Safaa Baig’s debut novel, sixteen-year old Katie Anderson thinks she is living the perfect teenage life, with a hilarious and fun family, average grades, a subscription to OK! Magazine, exclusive invitations to all the high-end parties and enough popularity at college to make every other girl want to be like her… that is, until her sensational, divorced father makes a decision that changes her life completely; he accepts Islam. Just a week before college is set to re-open, Katie finds her entire world shifting from beneath her. Engulfed with a mixture of confused feelings, a sudden change in lifestyle and a desire to battle her way back to normalcy, she begins a monumental search for guidance that will change her life forever…</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad! Where have you been? You were supposed to call the minute you got back. You promised,&#8221; I scolded him over the phone, only seconds after answering it.<br />
He chuckled, &#8220;Hey pumpkin, I missed you. I was going to call but… I got caught up with a few things.”<br />
“Like?”<br />
“You’ll know in due time.”<br />
“What,” I asked with exaggerated annoyance, “is up with all this secrecy? First Mark, then mum and now you —”<br />
“Guess what? I&#8217;ve got a surprise for you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You know that&#8217;s not gonna work, Dad. I’m not a child anymore, so stop —”<br />
“Look outside your window.”<br />
“What?”<br />
“I said look outside —”<br />
“Why?” I interrupted him, turning my body so that I was now facing my bedroom window. I peered at it cautiously, wondering if he’d planted some sort of prank there.<br />
“It’s a surprise,” he sang softly, obviously incredibly amused by the scenario.<br />
“No,” I replied, folding my arms defiantly as if he was actually there, watching me.<br />
“All right, well then…” he drew out his words, sounding surprised, “you’re missing out. Big time. I mean, who knows what could be lurking behind that window —”<br />
“Dad, I am so not falling for —”<br />
“I mean, do I know? Yeah. But do you? Nah, not so much.”<br />
“Dad.”<br />
“But then again, that’s just the choice you’ve made. And I’ve got to respect that, even if it means you’re missing out on something irrefutably astounding and unquestionably phenomenal —”<br />
“Oh, come on! Dad, don’t pull out the vocabulary card. That’s not fair —”<br />
“It saddens me to inform you of this, but Katie, my dear, you are a bromide.”<br />
I gasped, “I am not!” Mentally, I was wondering if he’d made up that word or if it actually existed. “I am not a bromide,” I said again with more vehemence, “I am the farthest thing from a bromide,” I continued, pulling a dictionary out from my bookshelf and flipping through it speedily, “if ever there was a person who was a bromide, it would not be me, for I am not a —”<br />
My dad laughed at the other end, “You won’t find it in the dictionary.”<br />
I scowled, “Fine, well then —” and stopped mid-sentence as I heard a loud honk outside. Furrowing my brow, I opened my mouth again, only to be stopped short again by another honk, this time sounding suspiciously as if it was coming from outside my window. Standing up slowly, I moved curiously towards my window, and pulled back the curtain in one swift move.<br />
“You were saying?” he asked, as I suddenly caught sight of a very familiar red Honda Accord Euro, with my dad seated inside, grinning broadly.<br />
I burst out laughing as I watched him wave at me comically. “Nice surprise, huh, Katie?”<br />
“Best surprise,” I giggled, “Give me five minutes and I&#8217;ll be down.”<br />
&#8220;No need, I&#8217;m coming in. I have to talk to your mum about a few things. Take your time,&#8221; he replied, stepping out of the car.<br />
&#8220;A few things? What?&#8221; I asked, impatiently.<br />
&#8220;Just need a few words with your mum. Okay, I&#8217;m gonna hang up now… because I&#8217;m here for goodness sake,&#8221; he laughed loudly and then hung up.<br />
I smiled to myself and skipped downstairs to welcome him. I reached the bottom of the staircase just as Mark opened the door and my smile slowly crept away as I saw Mark’s face turn livid.<br />
&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; I heard Mark demand, and I instantly slowed my steps.<br />
&#8220;I came to get Katie… look, Mark, it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. It’s… I… I miss you,&#8221; my dad said gently, his cheerless eyes resting upon Mark&#8217;s.<br />
&#8220;This is the only way, Dad… Jack. Katie&#8217;ll be down in a few minutes. You can wait outside,&#8221; he remarked gloomily, as he began to close the door.<br />
&#8220;Wait! Mark, what do you think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; I asked angrily as I ran up to the front door, pushing Mark out of the way to allow my dad in.<br />
Mark glowered at my dad as he coldly replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get to you, Katie,&#8221; and stomped out of the room.<br />
&#8220;Now, see, that’s someone I’d call a bromide,” I winked, “Don&#8217;t let him get to you, okay?&#8221;<br />
He laughed as he pulled me in for a tight hug, &#8220;I missed you so much, Kay.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It was your own fault for staying in Morocco for six months,&#8221; I joked, my voice muffled against his shirt.<br />
&#8220;Architect Extraordinaire on the job,&#8221; he grinned, holding me back to look at me. “You’ve grown.”<br />
“You say that every time you see me,” I rolled my eyes.<br />
“No, I mean it —”<br />
&#8220;What&#8217;s going on? I just saw Mark fuming in the living room,&#8221; my mum inquired as she suddenly walked into the room, a look of surprise on her face as she noticed my dad.<br />
&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re here early,&#8221; she said, seating herself on the sofa.<br />
&#8220;Drama, drama, drama. Dad needs to talk to you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yeah, there are a few things I need to discuss with you,&#8221; he added, then taking in my inquisitive eyes, chuckled, &#8220;privately.”<br />
&#8220;Oh sure, that&#8217;s nice. Get rid of me already. I&#8217;ll be in the living room,&#8221; I sighed as I went off to question Mark on his strange behaviour.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">Children and their parents enjoyed an adventure in the heart of the countryside as they escaped the turmoil of trying to rebuild their lives following the tower block fire eight months ago.  <u></u>Many are still living in hotels and temporary accommodation as they battle with authorities to find new homes and restore their lives.</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing"><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">A party of around 20 parents and children spent four days far away from their neighbourhood where the blackened shell of the tower acts as a constant reminder of their trauma.  <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6980" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_8722_preview.jpeg" alt="" width="1" height="1" />They visited a farm &#8211; and for some it was their first time feeding animals – walked in the woods and tried archery, climbing, campfire and den-building and woodland skills in the trip organised by Al Khair Foundation, a leading UK Muslim charity and its implementing partner Hear Women Foundation.</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing"> Florent Caillibotte, European Refugees Programme Officer of AKF said: “We wanted to lift the survivors’ spirits and take them away from their area which is still a difficult place to be in for them. <u></u>They are all trying hard to deal with the tragedy and to rebuild their lives but it is around them every day. We have been in the community providing practical and emotional support since the fire but felt the children would benefit from having a break in the countryside.”</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">Hisam Choucair, who lost six family members who lived on the 22<sup>nd</sup> floor, came on the trip with his children, Zahraa aged seven and Muhammed five. <u></u>“The outdoor life and the greenery are natural therapeutic things to bring joy to people at difficult times, especially for the children,” he said.<span class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u>“My children found this trip enjoyable. Everything has been taken away from them and they must feel empty and lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">&#8220;I lost my mum, my sister, all her children and my brother in law. I feel very empty, it’s not easy not having people around you. No support, family, or someone you feel you can come and speak to.<span class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u>“It’s really difficult. Although I smile, I’m being cut up inside. I’m broken but I have to stay strong for others especially my children. There’s not a moment that goes by that I don’t think of my family.”</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">Hisam, who lives seven minutes from the tower, alleges that the authorities wouldn’t let children visit the tower to pay their respects. <u></u>“It was only after I challenged them for a month on this matter that they changed their view and are allowing the children to visit the tower at a later stage. This has only been confirmed verbally via the authorities to myself but nothing has been confirmed in writing.”<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">“They were saying before that the children couldn&#8217;t even visit the outside perimeters to pay their respects,” he said. “What I saw on that day, is no different to what my children saw. There’s no reason why they can’t visit. It’s very sad that we have to challenge them. <u></u>“To say to one that you can come in but another can’t is an insult to my family and me.  <u></u>They should make it as easy as possible for people to overcome this but they are putting obstacles in the way just to make a visit.”<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing"> Mahad Ali Abdullah, who lived opposite Grenfell Tower, took his two children, Mohamed aged 18 and Safa 12, on the holiday, which was run by Surrey Outdoor Learning and Development at their centre near Dorking. <u></u>“It’s very beautiful here and we are disconnected from the outside world so it’s giving us full tranquillity. My children really enjoyed it,” he said.<span class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u>“It was very positive and exciting. It meant a lot to me and to my children. We have been praying together and talking together.”</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing"> Hisam’s sister Sawsan Choucair, who also lost six members of their family, said: “It’s a lovely place. It’s brilliant for the kids. There are lots of activities and people here are very friendly. We get together, have a talk and watch TV.  It was a change and something different outside of London. I’ve never been down this way. There’s a nice atmosphere and the children loved seeing all the animals and riding ponies.  The organisers and the workers were lovely, so friendly, everyone was fantastic and did anything to please us. We have all been traumatised since Grenfell. The people from Grenfell tower have gone through a lot. They need something for them.  This has let the kids have a good time.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Habibeh Syed plans for a day of farm visiting and finds something better.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Will it be too hot? What are we going to do there exactly? What are the kids going to do? What are the eating arrangements? More importantly, What time are we going to come back home?</em> These are thoughts filling my mind throughout the hour and a half journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I glance at my watch. <em>I don’t think I’m wearing the right shoes for this.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dirt chases our mini van as we pull into the parking lot. The van is filled with three whining children and two sets of parents running low on patience. I stumble out of the back seat and hold onto my hijab, fighting the grip of the warm breeze. It is the tail end of summer, and the blueberries are perfectly ripe on this Long Island berry farm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In almost an instant, the children are lost. My four-year-old daughter and her two cousins have found their ultimate escape. “Let them run,” my husband squints at me in the merciless sunlight. He senses my panic. He then hands me empty wicker baskets to fill up with berries to take home. I walk towards my brother-in-law and his wife who are quietly chatting near tall white buckets filled with vibrant sunflowers. We stroll down the hill and are facing rows upon rows of strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries. I am slightly embarrassed and surprised to realise that berries are not in fact grown on trees but on bushes ranging from what looked like three to eight feet tall depending on the type of berry. The raspberries, like tiny rubies of nature, hold on to their bushes swaying in the sun. They are followed by neat tight rows of blueberries, which are followed by blackberries, and finally strawberries that are closest to the brown shimmering earth. The smell of fresh cut grass with scents of sweet lavender and white hyacinths fills my lungs. It is a sight I will never forget. I grip my empty basket and head straight for the blueberries, my favourite of them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I resist looking at my watch and thinking of the traffic we will hit on our way back home. The sky is clear, blue and brighter than I remember it in the city. Before I know it, I am standing alone in the middle of tall hovering bushes packed with what I would later find out to be three types of blueberries; ripened sweet, tart and daringly sour. I pick and place and pick and eat. Pick, place, pick, eat. I find tranquility in this rhythmic pattern. My feet take me along from one neat row of drifting bushels to the next. Although I hear the faint screaming of our children running in the fields, discovering tasty fruits with their small and now dirty fingertips, there is a calm I have never felt before. The air is still and it hugs me with its dense summer warmth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly, I am listening to the afternoon murmur of occupied bees harvesting pollen from nearby sunflowers. It gets uncomfortably quiet. The kind of quiet I am not used to. I could hear myself breathe. For the very first time in my life, I forget where I am, who I am and lose all sense of responsibility. The questions I have trained to habitually ask myself have evaporated somewhere between the rows of these delicious gems. I slowly roam the bushels and fill up my basket. I don’t remember how long this goes on for, but I do remember the new feeling of simultaneously being free yet captivated. I don’t belong to time, but to the moment &#8211; this experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grew up in a household with five younger siblings and one best friend &#8211; planning. Between classes at school, after school activities, and Qur’an classes after the after school activities, meticulous planning was a practical way to keep my mum (and everyone else) sane. There was a time and a set schedule to follow to attain that sort of organisation. One misstep and everything was out of order. At least that’s what I was taught.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a working mother with a very energetic toddler and lots of family who keep me busy, I follow firm schedule planning and organising. This eye-opening trip to a berry farm brought forth to my attention a routine I had never practised before &#8211; tranquility before organising. It had triggered a spiritual awakening, bringing to a halt my excessive planning. I soaked up that day, and every moment of it was as delicious as the pops of blueberries in my mouth. The sweet smell of summer was exhilarating and the quietness was like nothing I had ever experienced in my entire life. It was both refreshing and enlightening to just live in that second instead of rushing, ceaselessly trying to beat the ever-ticking clock of my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weeks later, in an attempt to capture the summer’s last traces, I would follow Jannah on her tricycle, watching her oversized helmet secured to her head. On our last trip to the park, she stopped to look at a worm writhing on the sidewalk and then got off her bike to pick me a dandelion she mistook for a daisy because she knows those are my favourite. Then she stopped and asked for help counting the cars that drive by. Ordinarily, I would have got impatient and rushed her to the park where she was supposed to be having fun. But I didn’t mind. I thought to myself, this is the moment. Her curiosity brings out the best in her, and her interpretation of a good time kicks my planning book to the curb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes I have one of those. Post-it’s sticking out of it to mark important dates and the to-do lists on them will testify to my obsessive nature of over-organising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undeniably, plans are a big part of life. Without them, there truly would be chaos. Production, innovation and order exist in the process of planning and preparing. But the biggest plan of all that we forget to consider at times is in the hands of our Creator. We are so programmed to be at a specific place at a specific time, we forget the valuable moments that matter. A sweltering day at a berry farm jolted me to see the quality of my time rather than the quantity. I had programmed my life in strict increments: an hour max must be spent here, two hours set aside for there. As a result of this awakening, I now calculate moments in the genuine experience of them rather than in time. A dinner with friends is about enjoying good food with even better company rather than a couple hours of required visiting on a Friday night. A walk with my husband is spending quality time together instead of a predetermined scribbling of “30 minute walk with the hubby” as directed by my post-it. I can laugh it off now when I am late because I know I am only human and I can only control so many aspects of my life. Most importantly, I have given myself at least one day out of the week to do things that make me truly happy, and to my surprise, planning isn’t one of them.</p>

The message the prophet (SAW) received tells us to live as brothers and sisters in the ummah (the body of all Muslims from all times) without regard for race or tribe, to fear Allah (SWT) and to reconcile with each other whenever possible. When this message was first made known it launched a tidal wave of transformative peace among a people who were, to put it mildly, a little rough around the edges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what happened? How did we get from a time of radical peace to an era in which Muslims oppress, torture, imprison and kill their innocent brothers, and even women and children, justifying it all &#8211;  may they repent and be forgiven &#8211; in the name of the very religion that forbids such practices? How have so many Muslims come to accept that tyranny, with all its inherent corruption, is necessary to maintaining social order? And why do so many Muslim business people insist that they have to cheat customers in order to make a living?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, in addition to the horrifying and seemingly unending internal conflicts within Muslim countries, which outside forces are only too willing to aggravate, we often can be heard whining to each about our inferior status in the world today. &#8221;We are the slaves of Allah (SWT)! Why are they achieving so much while all we do is struggle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To some extent we must all each hold ourselves personally responsible for the current maelstrom in the Muslim world, at least to the extent that we&#8217;ve gotten into the habit of ignoring the warning &#8211; and the marvelous directive &#8211; handed down to us in Surat Al-Asr.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong> “By time, indeed, mankind is in loss, except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.”</strong> (Surat Al-Asr, The Declining Day)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Pursuing your<em> deen</em> (Islam-based lifestyle) without these words is like following a map that doesn&#8217;t tell you where the snake-pits and grizzly bears are. Before embarking on our life’s journey we need these words to remind us that humanity&#8217;s natural state is one of forgetting. It’s our natural tendency to lose sight of truth and enter a state of loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Pillars of Conflict</strong><br />
Karen Horney, the eminent German psychoanalyst, once said of neurotic conflicts that they “cannot be resolved by rational decision. But these conflicts can be resolved by changing the conditions within the personality that brought them into being.” The same can be said of larger political conflicts, which, it can be argued, are every bit as unhealthy and futile as psychological conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what are the conditions that keep cycles of unrest and violence alive? There are many interrelated factors working together to perpetuate and aggravate political conflict, but we can greatly simplify the picture by reducing the conditions of violence to two main pillars: lies and impatience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I. Lies</strong><br />
Let’s start with lies, which play a starring role on the world stage during times of political instability. Lies create, maintain and exacerbate conflict and media and governments are only too willing to heap fuel on the fire by creating and spreading propaganda. It has become increasingly difficult for honest journalists to find the truth; people on both sides of each conflict have been lied to so much that they’re passionately certain their side is right. Muslims now are often willing to say anything to persuade the rest of us to join and support them. Add to this the lies of those who have a large political or financial stake in the outcome and the web of lies becomes so thick you can barely see through it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a recent Tedtalks episode, Pamela Meyer exhorts us to marginalise lying in our lives &#8211; that is, to push it to the edges by remaining honest ourselves and by refusing to accept lies from others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II. Impatience</strong><br />
Now let’s look at the second pillar of political conflict: impatience. In our everyday lives we think of impatience as a small vice, cute even, something we joke about. But the failure to restrain anger, grief, frustration and desire has sent countless innocent people to their deaths. Not only that, when we jump the gun on our Creator, we sabotage the good things He has in store for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The early Muslim warriors weren’t like Rambo. They took no delight in killing, they didn’t boast, they didn’t kill out of rage. If they had to kill, they did so in obedience. There was no glamour attached to it and they were well aware that their religion called for peace and that only in being good slaves of Allah I could they escape the cycles of violence that have plagued humanity since its beginnings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exhort!</strong><br />
Now that we realise how big a role lies and impatience play in creating these cycles of violence, is it enough simply to apply them to our personal lives? Apparently not, as Surat Al-Asr clearly spells out the importance of exhorting each other &#8211; that is, encouraging and reminding each other &#8211; to truth and sabr (patience).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your friends in war-torn countries are suffering, you need to be supportive and sympathetic. But when they launch into racist diatribes against their enemies, when they ignore their own sins and exaggerate those of others, do you gently remind them to be calm and honest, awaiting the justice of Allah I or do you incite them to seek revenge? In your political discussions, do you propose intellectual solutions or try to unravel the web of lies and suggest peaceful ways of coping with and resisting oppression?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start imagining an ummah with no lies and no sinful, rash reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then let’s watch the world transform. Insha Allah we may see another Islamic renaissance, a peaceful era in which we can all thrive, blossom and participate in marvellous achievements, to the glory of our Creator. Ameen.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Margari Hill Aziza addresses our collective denial about the dangers Muslim youth face and create.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Media coverage of the mass shootings of Sandy Hook and Aurora Colorado theatre should make Muslims worldwide aware of the proliferation of guns and the culture of violence in America. These tragic events have sparked a national dialogue about gun control, the culture of violence, and mental health. But the American Muslim voice is surprisingly absent from the gun control debate. Muslims often think that they are immune to the problems in broader society. This has led to a magical thinking about our children’s safety and lack of support for policies that could curb gun violence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muslim youth in the inner city are just as vulnerable to street violence as non-Muslims. But, outside of honour killings and hate crimes, the issue of gun violence and its effects on inner city Muslim communities are rarely talked about. Most African American Muslims know a friend or family member who has been injured or killed in gunfire. Last semester, my young African American Muslim student asked me to excuse her absence so that she could help her family make arrangements for her brother’s janazah. The 19-year-old had been shot following a verbal altercation in West Philadelphia, an all too frequent occurrence. My cousin Ara Hayward, who is also Muslim, recounted the story of her husband who survived getting shot four times in front of her house. Their stories, as well as the many janazahs I have attended while working in the Philadelphia Muslim community, have raised my awareness that gun violence is a problem. As mums, we have to stop thinking that Arabic names, hijabs, and kufis will shield our children from danger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Philadelphia Police Department, there were 331 homicides and 1232 shooting victims in 2012. Although the police reports do not indicate the religious identities of the victims or perpetrators, it is clear that there are many Muslim names on both lists. In order to understand the effects of gun violence on the Muslim community, I began to survey Muslims and contact hospital chaplains and masajid. Several respondents to my survey stated that they know of as many as 10 to 15  Muslims killed since 2001. One mother has created QAAMS Hajj foundation, to help facilitate the Hajj for Muslim youth in honour of her son, Qa’id Ameer Abdul-Majeed Staten. He was gunned down in 2003. In the past five years in Philadelphia, I have seen a number of Muslim families devastated by gun violence. Some  victims are caught in crossfire like Qa’id, including the young mother of four, Hafeezah Nuri-Deen or the 18 year old Shakuwrah Muhammad who had plans to attend college to become a forensic scientist. There are others who were shot in robberies, such as the newlywed from Morocco, Quadii Soulimani, who was shot just outside the masjid doors on his way to the morning prayer and the 40 year Egyptian America old store clerk, Mustafa Shaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patterns of street violence are not limited to American inner cities or African Americans.  Media reports have shown that South Asian and British Muslim gangs exist, scholars have pointed to the rate of Muslims in French prisons, and some Australian reports claim that Muslim immigrants are five times more likely to be involved in crime. Perhaps we need to look at the problem of disaffection of our youth, globally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the magical thinking results in parents overlooking their children getting involved in crime. Aliya Khabir, author of the Islamic Urban fiction novel, Just Be Still, points out that inner city Muslim communities are not addressing gun violence. She observed, “We walk around like it doesn’t exist. We pretend like we’re not the perpetrators either.” She noted, “Looking at my third grade class picture from Clara Muhammad School, only four out of all the guys in a class of 33 have never spent any time in jail.” Muslims have been involved in robberies, cop killings, and even one child kidnapping. Some parents restrict their daughters, but they are much more permissive with their boys. Mums forget how persuasive popular media and peer pressure can be. Many of our youth are not involved in crime or gangs, but because they want to be accepted they may find themselves in harm’s way by hanging out with gang members. This is why we have to be vigilant about our children’s peer groups, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>    Although the police reports do not indicate the religious identities of the victims or perpetrators, it is clear that there are many Muslim names on both lists.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our communities also have to move beyond magical thinking. Many inner city mosques are located in areas of high frequency gun violence and crime. Some Muslim leaders have taken a stand against violence, participating in interfaith peace walks. But some of our communities have developed an insular approach and assumed that these are the problems of the kuffar. Collectively, communities have not developed programmes to make streets safer for Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Instead, we long for the good old days when wearing Islamic garb would protect Muslims from harm. However, Muslims earned that respect from their commitment to developing the community and living exemplary lives. Our failure to address the social decay and blight surrounding our masajid in the past two decades has been the greatest blemish on our record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to begin to think of programmes that can affect positive change in our communities, including economic development, neighbourhood watches and youth programming. This is where we need to think about programmes such as Cure Violence, which has been featured in the documentary The Interrupters. Ameena Matthews has courageously stood on the frontlines, positively impacting her community. Her work demonstrates that curbing violence is not simply pushing legislation, but also transforming the culture and communities in which we live. And this is the work we have to do to ensure the safety of our children and those who come after them.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Rahma K finds Muslims making some embarrassing anti-dawah actions on social media.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While browsing videos on a Facebook page, I chanced upon a graphic video of a woman burning to death. The caption read “The Azab (punishment) of Allah on the woman who put the burqa (full veil) on fire in a protest against the wearing of burqa in India.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I thought it was just a video with a sensationalised caption, but when I watched it I felt chilled all over. I had never seen anyone being burnt alive in my life before and the impact it had on me was immense. My instant thought was ‘So this is what it would be like, this is what I will go through for rejecting the signs of my Rabb and sinning against my own self?’ Needless to say, I never will be able to remove the image from my memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I felt a bit more normal I marveled, ’How strange that the one who had uploaded the video felt smug enough to caption it thus’. ‘The Azab of Allah’, a phrase so casually thrown around by Muslims nowadays who, despite indulging in every sin named in the book, feel they will only be welcomed with garlands of fragrant flowers at the doors of Jannah. But what was more shocking was the plethora of comments on the video that reeked of the same self righteousness. Ranging from ‘“Subhan Allah” to “Allah o Akbars” to open condemnations of “This is what you get for rejecting the signs of Allah,” the comments were disgusting in their complacency for accepting the fate of the woman as well-deserved and in fact called-for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we will come to the comments later. The next day when I felt somewhat normal again, something did not sit right with me about the video. If this protest did in fact take place how come I never heard of it in the news? A hate mongering protest like that, followed by such a fearsome death would have made the headlines all over for sure. So I checked the video on Youtube and after a little browsing amazingly it turned out that the protest had nothing to do with abaya even remotely. It was a protest carried out by a fraternity of teachers against the state of Punjab in India in 2010, which turned bad after some teachers tried to demonstrate their anger at the government for not meeting their demands by putting a dupatta (long scarf worn by women in sub-continent) of one of the protesting women on fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you imagine? I marvel at the cunning of the one who conveniently omitted the opening few seconds of the original video where one of the protesting women took off her own scarf from around her neck and put it on the railing to burn it. Since the scarf was black it could be easily mistaken for an abaya.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delighting in the conspiracy theories as we all do, we would like to believe it was not a Muslim who uploaded this falsely captioned video; that it was in fact a Muslim hater who wanted to malign the religion of Islam who was behind it. But what a shame it is on the intellect of the Muslims who accepted the caption to be true without questioning the authenticity of the video and proceeded to share it with derogatory captions and comments. If I, with my average level of intelligence, could figure out that something smelled fishy in the story then we would have to grade our common Muslim masses way below average. It is an irony that it simply never crosses our minds to investigate on a sensationalised and sometimes even downright fantastic bit of news items posted on the social media, and we are the people who have been warned against spreading falsehood, spying, over assuming, slandering and backbiting in our religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see this trend being followed all over the internet. Youtube is full of knavishly photo-shopped fake natural miracle videos trying to prove the divinity of Islam and they are widely shared by thousands of Muslims on social media, and commented upon by more without any sense or reason. Not too long ago the fiasco regarding the claims that a female Nasa astronaut converted to Islam after hearing the sounds of adhan in space really put our intelligence to shame as a people. We are so eager to clutch onto some manifested miracle in nature proving the divinity of our religion, yet we fail to appreciate its true miracle, the Qur’an, which we have shoved behind our backs. Qur’an was the miracle of our Prophet (SAW) and if we really want to impress upon this world the truth of Islam, it is only through this book that we can achieve that feat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although seemingly innocent, this trend of fake miracle videos among our ummah makes us sound ignorant and at times even pompous and needless to say leaves a very bad impression of us as a nation on the onlooker. But when it comes to the wrongly captioned video of a woman meeting a sad end in an unfortunate accident, this tendency to seem high and mighty ceases to be innocent. It is downright deceitful, prejudiced and a hate mongering act, and it has brought much harm and resentment against us in the hearts of those who know little about our religion. With all the media propaganda against Islam today, this ignorant trend just helps seal the negative image of Muslims in the eyes of those who already see us as enemies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What disturbed me profusely, besides the fake video itself and its caption, is the self-righteousness, conceit and arrogance of the posters and viewers, the downright inhumanity and hate behind the comments, and this from the followers of a prophet who was Rahmatullil Alameen (mercy to the mankind); who spent every ounce of energy in his body to bring people away from the brim of fire. To whom Allah (SWT) in His book said <em><span style="color: #bf134a;"><strong>“Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Muhammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow”</strong></span></em><span style="color: #999999;"><em> (Al-Kahf:6).</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He, who could not even imagine without anguish the fate of the ones who rejected his message, let alone watch them burn in person and smugly say “Serves you right”. He, who was given the glad tidings of Jannah yet cried out of fear of Allah (SWT), and so did his companions who bared the torch of his message with ultimate fidelity. Yet these loved ones of Allah (SWT) were fearful for themselves and cried for their own souls, while we smugly watch such videos and congratulate ourselves for having a Muslim name on our passport which we feel is our pass to Jannah as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O ummah of Muhammad (SAW), what have you come to? If anything this video should have made you resolve to reach out to each and every brother in humanity and bring them away from the flames of hellfire by showing them the light of this true deen. If in fact you were so sure of your own salvation, your heart should have bled for those who stand in danger of falling into the fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I am reminded of a Qur&#8217;anic dua where we beseech Allah (SWT) to not make us a fitnah (test) for the disbelievers, that through our conduct they are driven away from this beautiful deen. After all aren’t we supposed to be the people of this verse?</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf134a;"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em><span style="color: #bf134a;"><strong>“You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah….”</strong> </span><span style="color: #999999;">(Al-Imran:110)</span></em><br />

		<description><![CDATA[Na’ima B. Robert ruminates on the effects of a small slip-up.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is a series of tests. Often times, they leap out at you when you least expect them, ambushing you, shattering your sense of complacency, your unfounded sense of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, this life is a series of tests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, we pass. We do the right thing, the better thing, even though it is harder, less pleasant, more inconvenient than going with the flow and blending in. That takes courage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other times, we fail. We acquiesce for the sake of a quiet life. For who doesn’t want a quiet life after all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine you decide to change your eating habits. You decide to start eating healthily, staying away from creamy, fried foods and sweet desserts. It’s hard, but you know it’s the right thing to do for your health and wellbeing. You know that it will be worth it in the end, that your body will thank you for it. And you can take the high road, urge others to follow your example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when you are surrounded by others who are also eating healthily, it is that much easier. You remind each other, encourage each other, explore ways to make healthy eating fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But suppose, one day, you go out to eat with friends who are not what you are upon. They are tucking into steaks, lasagne, ravioli and risotto. You order the salad, feeling virtuous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the dessert tray arrives. And everyone orders with gusto: cheesecake, passion cake, crumble, chocolate mousse. You hear that voice in your head screaming, “Just this once! It won’t kill you!” And all your friends turn into echoes of that little voice: “Come on, live a little! You’ve been so good! A little dessert won’t hurt!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so you order too, guilt gnawing at your insides. But the dessert is sweet. It tastes good. And you’ve missed tiramisu so much. By the time you have finished, the guilt has been smothered by the pleasure of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so it begins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon, every time you are with your gourmet friends, you order dessert regularly, without any guilty feelings. Then you join them for fried scampi, biryani and cream of mushroom soup, depending on the cuisine. No guilt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And your healthy diet is a thing of the past, a forgotten relic of a former life.You don’t even enjoy being with your health-conscious friends any more &#8211; they are too boring, too self-righteous, too judgmental. They take healthy eating too seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until you look in the mirror one day and see for yourself how far you have fallen from the mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, cream cakes and Italian food are not sins. But the metaphor holds for the other temptations in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Muslims, we are aiming to live a sacred life, a life centred on worship of and &#8211; crucially &#8211; obedience to the Creator of the heavens and the earth. This is no small feat, particularly in a world where unIslamic values come in the most glamorous and seductive packaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be it praying on time, eschewing interest (riba’), wearing the correct hijab, avoiding free mixing, or turning away from lewd sounds and images, our society is littered with tests to our resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In such a climate, it is easy to slip up, to give in to the allure of prevailing values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing about giving in to pressure, be it from peers, family or the wider society, is that it is a slippery slope. You slip up once and you feel it keenly. Your heart aches and remorse floods your being. You are fearful of repeating that mistake, afraid of slipping again. So you are vigilant with yourself, guarding yourself against corrupting influences. You are right to be on your guard for Shaitaan and his cohorts are like sharks that have smelled blood, they are circling, circling, poised to strike and finish the believer off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, if you let down your guard again, if you give in to that insistent voice that soothes your feelings of guilt and absolves you of blame, you slip a bit more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Everyone else is doing it &#8211; it can’t be that bad&#8230;’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And each time you slip, it becomes harder to pull yourself back up towards the peak you were striving for. The peak begins to look too far, too far away from where you are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘We have to be realistic &#8211; we’re not the sahabah&#8230;’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You lose sight of what you were aiming for. And you start to feel comfortable lower down the mountainside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And where once each slip was accompanied by tears, fear, tawbah, now the slips feel inevitable, become more comfortable. Your standards are lowered and you feel too tired to push yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until something happens to make you remember why you are here. What you are striving for. Why the sacrifice is worth it. That this deen began strange and that it will end strange as it began, that glad tidings are for the strangers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you remember that that strangeness is something prophesied, something to be expected, welcomed, even when it hurts like anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when it hurts like anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just something I learned recently that I thought I would share with you. If you’ve never experienced this feeling, then praise Allah. if you have, then I don’t need to explain it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Poem excerpted from ‘Death of a Beautiful Dream’ by Saira Anwar]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I walk alone and find myself walking through the ocean waves,<br />
where no one has ever been before.<br />
Together the ocean waves whirl, and<br />
smack over the golden sand.<br />
The ocean of dreams, the ocean of hopes,<br />
that’s further placed upon thy heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the deepness of the ocean lies a silent breeze,<br />
of hopes and dreams; where you can find<br />
faith and peace, even when you do not dream.<br />
As the existence of hopes and dreams lie within,<br />
you take a leap and immerse yourself in its deepness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ocean of hopes and dreams begins to sink in.<br />
Upon this vast ocean; me a lonely soul.<br />
Over the ocean waves and across the beach sand,<br />
I found myself where no one had ever been before.<br />
The ocean of hopes and dreams,<br />
where my untold journey began.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[J. Samia Mair steps into the sisters’ side of the mosque, pausing to consider why she can’t hear herself pray.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Soap box?” I reply intrigued.  I have an opportunity to voice a pet peeve? I smile to myself, sitting in front of the computer screen.  I don’t have to think about it for a second. I know exactly what I want to write!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case in point: I walk into the musalla for ‘Isha prayers before Tawareeh. There is a group of what appears to be high school girls sitting in a circle in the back of the small room. Next to them is a group of younger girls, deeply engrossed in their own conversation. I begin to do the two raka’at  for the masjid. I can’t hear myself think. There are giggles and loud voices. Normally, I would try to concentrate even harder, but it’s impossible. I politely walk over to the older girls’ gab session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Pardon me, pardon me,” I say two or three times, finally getting their attention. “I can’t hear myself pray. This is a musalla. Do you think that you could take your conversation to another room?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They look at me, somewhat surprised, apologise politely and slightly embarrassingly, and thankfully leave. I turn to the younger girls who, by the way, are so engrossed in their own conversation that they have not even noticed that the older girls have left or that I am standing above them trying to get their attention. I ask for the same bit of courtesy and the second group of girls leaves. I can now pray in peace &#8211; at least that’s what I think. But I hadn’t counted on their mothers! Mums have now entered the musalla, bringing their lively conversation with them. But it is not as easy to approach your peers or elders and ask them to be quiet. Even the adhan or the imam beginning the prayers is no deterrent!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now it all makes tragic, tragic, generational sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t get it. I don’t get it. I mean, I DON’T GET IT! No one would talk loudly in a church when a priest is giving his sermon. No one would even think about having a long, drawn out discussion in a business meeting when a colleague was giving a presentation. No student in a classroom, with any sense of survival, would be so engrossed in a side conversation that neither the teacher nor the other students could hear themselves think. But something happens to some women &#8211; and yes, I am purposefully referring to only one gender &#8211; when they enter the masjid. They seem to completely forget all manners and make it nearly impossible for the rest of us to concentrate. I can’t tell you how many “a’oodhu billaahis” I have to say to myself to control my thoughts. Should it surprise us that we are often banished to a small dark and dreary room, tucked away, silenced and suffocated, trapped with screaming infants and disobedient kids!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahhh &#8211; I feel so much better now that that’s out…But do I? Do I really feel that much better? Is this welcomed, appreciated, therapeutic, cathartic diatribe going to change things? I have complained about the talking before and the response had been, “It’s cultural. We must take baby steps.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cultural! Baby steps!!! I scream silently, painfully to myself. I know for a fact that many of these women are lovely people and come from tremendous cultures; indeed, they are adults, perfectly capable of understanding that the musalla is not the place to hold disrupting conversations. Please, our gender deserves more credit than that! Perhaps, I wonder, is something else is going on? Perhaps…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Hmm,” I say to myself. Perhaps, the apparent disrespect is a reflection of the disrespect women’s space is given in many masjids &#8211; or a reflection of the lack of respect given to our opinions when it comes to masjid matters &#8211; or a reflection of the barriers and faulty sound systems that make hearing an imam a feat of great achievement &#8211; or, perhaps, just perhaps, we were never expected to listen…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder: are these women protesting, unconsciously, in their own way, developed over centuries, the inequities experienced when those in power do not follow the Sunnah? When the reply to an earnest request is often, “I am not the Prophet”? Perhaps, they have realised that when one lung is incapacitated, the whole body suffers &#8211; and they can’t understand why the other lung wants to breathe alone? Perhaps, I do get it. But that, my dear readers, is a topic for another Soap Box!</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="color: #db0964;">It was his right after all, his privilege to unpin her veil, his entitlement to look at her in her bridal finery. </span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing her in the crowded airport hall, lost in the swarms of grey people, he wondered how he could even for a second fear that he wouldn’t recognise her. Here she was, nearly within his reach, his bride, his lawfully wedded wife upon whose sublime face he was now legally allowed to look for as long as he wanted. She was dressed in her bridal finery, in a full length bright red lengha dress embroidered with sequins and crystals, with a heavy veil pinned to her hair, so heavy that it forced her head down in that classic bridal pose. Her hands, and her feet in high-heeled sandals were adorned with intricate henna designs and her wrists and fingers decorated with gold and jewels. His precious bride, she was a jewel thrown among the pebbles, looking out for him too, searching for his face among the faces of strangers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He thought how out of place she looked here in this crowded airport hall. Of course there were people looking at her, commenting on her unusual outfit, yet not understanding anything, not giving her the attention and respect she deserved. How different it should be. How different it should have been! She should be sitting like a queen on the throne on a scene decorated with velvet and fresh flowers, in her maternal home in a beautiful valley of Neelum. And there should be people coming to see her, wedding guests loudly commenting on her beauty and appreciating her shyness. “Masha Allah! What a beautiful bride,” she should hear, instead of the hushed whispers of strangers passing her by, spoken in languages she couldn’t comprehend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that moment, he was so sorry for her that he felt his heart shrinking in his chest. She came here just for him. All the way from her village hidden in the high mountains of the Pakistani province of Kashmir, she had had to travel for hours on bumpy winding roads, partially destroyed by landslides so common in that area. He thought that she must have left in the middle of the night to reach the airport in Islamabad on time. Or maybe she spent a night there, anxious not to miss the flight. He wondered if she had ever before travelled as far as the airport? And then she would have boarded the plane, her heart beating fast from the fear of the unknown, from the fear of flying. Each bride has to go through this, through this apprehension of the new and mysterious future that lay ahead, but for her, for his bride, it was so much harder. She had left her country and her people and had flown, all alone, to her husband whom she had not seen since they were both children, because he was not able to arrive for their wedding due to visa issues, and a nikah brother, his chosen delegate, had signed the wedding contract on his behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How tired she must be after such a long journey in all those fancy clothes and jewellery! Why did they even make her wear it for the journey? he thought angrily. But he knew the answer. It was his right after all, his privilege to unpin her veil, his entitlement to look at her in her bridal finery. He was angry with himself. Why did he make her go through this? Of course, he could justify himself saying it was not his idea, he could wait, he was in no hurry to get married. It was his parents insisting on his wedding, the sooner the better. And then, he remembered her face, her smiling eyes and delicate curves of the cheeks. He remembered how they used to play together, how much they loved each other as children, how many times he had promised to marry her when he would grow up. He remembered walking her home up the mountains on the moonlit nights and helping her carry the water from the streams when no one looked. They were happy there and then. Why couldn’t it stay that way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because he was fortunate enough to get the UK visa, to become the chosen one among his brothers and cousins, the one upon whom the family survival would largely depend. He would travel to the land of plenty, where he would feel no cold and no hunger, and he would earn to support his family. All of them unfortunate enough to be left in Pakistan &#8211; poor and corrupted Pakistan. But it turned out that the Promised Land was not as good as he had imagined. Yes, there was money, but a poor person remains a poor person wherever he moves. It’s just a different quality of poverty. He could afford to send pounds to his mother, so she wouldn’t worry about the cost of food or the school fees for his siblings, but he couldn’t afford the fresh air, the lush greenery, the open space and the beautiful scenic landscape of his Kashmir, the sense of belonging. His freedom! All that was truly beautiful and worthy, he had to give up. Of course this wisdom came after years of hard work, after his eyes got accustomed to the sights of fully stacked shelves in the supermarket and after he got used to the idea that he could afford a new jacket, even though he didn’t need it. He was free to have, but he was not free to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now her &#8211; his wife. Would he ever be able to make her happy here? Here he was alone, and so would she be. Here, he looked every day at the grey sky and missed the clear blue skies of his motherland. Would she miss it too? He could promise to buy her whatever she wished for, but what if she wished for things money cannot buy? Could he ever give her home? Could he ever make her feel at home again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then they stood face to face. Whatever could be said was too much and not enough. So he took her by the hand and carried her suitcase, walking with her to the taxi that he drove. Together they would return to his house, now their house. His heart was beating fast and he longed to embrace her. To feel home again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Klaudia Khan spins a tale of mind over heart.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noreen was a sworn enemy of ‘love marriage’ for a myriad of reasons. To begin with, it was against her religious and cultural tradition – this was the reason Noreen mentioned most often, even though she herself did not believe it to be the most important one. It just happened to be the one most people understood and agreed with. There was also the question of suitability, of bride and groom being matched to each other on social, intellectual and – let’s admit it – physical levels. And here again most people just couldn’t help nodding their heads in agreement with this rationale. But what really motivated Noreen’s extreme dislike of a marital union based on mutual affection was she believed love doesn’t exist. Noreen had no doubt about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course it all depends what you qualify as love, but if you think it has something to do with quickened heartbeats, butterflies in the stomach, and blind admiration, then in Noreen’s eyes you are simply a hopeless romantic synonymous with senseless daydreamer and believer in make believe. The heart is simply a pump driving blood in circles throughout your body. Sometimes it works faster, for example, when we need more oxygen for our muscles to cope with extra exercise or our brain with extra emotions. But to think that emotions, namely love, could drive our life, and to let it take control over our decisions, well that is simply senseless. It is especially senseless when it comes to marriage. After all, it is a decision that will affect all aspects of your future life. InshaAllah it is a decision for life. How can you make it based on such a fleeting and unstable thing as love?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s face it, love &#8211; like any other emotion – is short lived. You feel this high for a maximum of a few months and then the fuel for passion begins to burn out. Also, being so infatuated you hardly notice the world around you; everything is suddenly beautiful and the ugliness becomes either unconventional beauty or invisible. And the same process is applied to the faults and shortcomings of your object of attention. Simply said – you become love blind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let’s just suppose that someone goes ahead and makes a decision while stupefied by this so-called love. What is the guarantee, that after the intoxicating emotion evaporates from their body, they don’t regret it? Or even worse, what if the thunder of love strikes twice and each time burns the forest? “You know if a guy wants to marry you, because he’s in love with you, what makes you think that after a year he wouldn’t marry another girl, because he falls in love with her?” asked Noreen of her girlfriends, some of them fatally affected by love, in hope of pouring some sense into their heads. Soon though, the girls learnt it was better not to confide in Noreen, an otherwise great friend, but who when it came to love issues her advice would either kill the joy or kill the friendship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being so skeptical about love, how did she anticipate her future marriage, wondered all Noreen’s cousins, aunties and friends. But Noreen wasn’t worried in the least, because she had a plan. She would trust her parents in finding the best possible match for her, having thoroughly instructed them in some of the more precise elements of compatibility factors. Noreen let her mother know about what she considered to be good-looking. She would either say, “Yeah, ok,” to agree with her mother’s opinion on someone’s good looks or roll her eyes saying “Mum, please,” when she disagreed, knowing that this was enough for her mother to get the idea. With her father, she had discussed the suitable professions of her potential husband, and she asked him to make sure the candidate’s professed dedication to religious duties would be checked and confirmed. Otherwise she left the decision fully in her parents’ hands. She didn’t even ask to see photos of the suitors and she declined meeting them during official applications of the groom’s parents for the girl to be given in marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was a beautiful, modest, pious, well-educated girl from a good family, so her parents were really spoilt for choice when it came to her engagement. After being approached by a respected family living in the neighbourhood and after meticulously screening the candidate through direct questioning as well as intelligence reports from friends and neighbours, and after imploring their daughter’s permission to which she responded, ”I trust your decision will be the best for me,” Mr. and Mrs. Adam Khan had finally agreed to betroth their beloved daughter Noreen to the son of Mr. and Mrs. Iqbal. The prospective son-in-law was two years older than Noreen and had just obtained a degree in law. He was good looking, and not only in the eyes of Noreen’s mother – in fact she had heard from some of the ladies in the neighbourhood that his looks attracted quite a lot of female attention. After a few chats Noreen’s father had with the young man, he deemed him reasonable and intelligent, as well as well-rounded and respectful. Based on these reports, Noreen believed that he actually was the perfect candidate and the best possible match. She didn’t want to discuss the issue much though, because she was afraid to be mistaken for accumulating some affection for her future husband, or – God forbid – falling in love!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nay! When it comes to love, the real love, Noreen had another plan. Her heart was not made of stone or sculpted in ice as some friends suspected. That was not the case. Noreen might have not believed in love in the popular, cheap sense of the word, but she believed in love cultivated within the sanctioned frame of marriage. Just as some snob gardeners believe that wild roses are not respectable roses and only those fostered in nurseries under the vigilance of expert eyes really deserved the name, so Noreen believed that love could only be developed meticulously between the spouses starting from the day of their marriage, not earlier. She planned to open her heart the moment he lifted her veil, all the time keeping her eyes open to learn to love him with all his faults, but focusing on his good side. She believed that their love would grow slowly and steadily until it reached perfect harmony after several years, and from then on they would share a life full of marital bliss. This vision had nothing to do with the romantic ideas of Noreen’s friends, oh no, it was thoroughly rational. And wasn’t it the way the things worked in the past? And everyone knows that things did work best in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noreen didn’t  waste much of her time or attention on the wedding preparation; she had more important things to do such as finishing her degree in Islamic studies and reading self-development books. Noreen let her mother do everything, including choosing the dress, the jewellery and the makeup artist. Some people thought that she must have been dragged into this union if she behaved like this, but she met their accusations calmly explaining that she simply trusted that her mother would know what is best for her. When prompted, she did choose emeralds over rubies for her wedding necklace and decided on the model of the dress from the catalogue. But she didn’t engage in the rest of the preparation, perfectly content to act as a spectator until the big day, when she would step up to play the lead role without rehearsing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally the big day had come, the guests had arrived and the show was to begin. Noreen was much more nervous than she expected she would be, but she explained to herself that this was just because she would have to face such a crowd, something that always made her nervous. She let her mother and cousins help her dress in a heavily embroidered traditional Desi red wedding dress. She let the hairdresser comb her hair and attach the veil with the hairpins, and she let the makeup artist do her job. She then looked in the mirror and didn’t recognise herself – how differently did she look in the make-up she never wore before and dressed in a princess-like dress instead of her usual simple black abaya. Strangely enough, seeing herself so altered had further calmed Noreen down, as if in this costume of a bride she was not truly herself – she was now a bride, and should and could act as a bride. Her role was not rehearsed, but she had chosen this improvisational style of acting. She would play it cool, what she imagined to be ‘old-style’. Like the modest brides of the olden times, the ones that didn’t dare lift their eyes from the ground or exchange a word with anyone. She had heard that her grandmother during her wedding ceremony did not even open her eyes – she just sat there like a beautiful monument – a perfect bride. Noreen pondered on doing the same, but decided that nowadays it would be considered overacting and instead fixed her gaze on the tips of her golden court shoes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wedding was a whirlwind of colours, faces, voices, wishes, blessings, and smells. To keep her composure Noreen revised in her head all the short surahs that she had memorised and repeatedly asked Allah for strength and courage. It was her wedding, yet the enjoyment was for all the others. The groom sitting next to her in the scene smiled and chatted with the family and guests and from time to time stood up to join his friends at a table or to pose for a picture. His place in the chair next to Noreen was quickly taken up by ladies eager to have a photo taken with a bride. Finally all the rites had been performed, the food had been served and eaten, the guests took their leave one after another and Noreen had been escorted to her husband’s car to be taken to her new home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the way home she did not lift her gaze nor speak a word, not even when he took her hand in his or when he asked if she was alright. She couldn’t shake off the role that she had adopted. <em>I’ll be myself again when I take off this dress,</em> she thought to herself. When they arrived she was greeted by all the female members of the household and extended family and led inside by her husband and her father-in-law. She mustered a smile, but her face, pale even under heavy make-up, gave away her tiredness and she was allowed to retire to her room. She closed the door and looked around the bedroom, her bedroom now, that she was to share with that stranger she met only a few hours ago. She sat on a stool in front of a dressing table with an ornately framed mirror and began to unpin her veil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The door cracked open and her husband – how strangely this phrase felt on her tongue! – entered the room closing the door behind him and locking it. “Let me help you,” he said standing behind her as he started to remove the pins from her hair. She looked down, but not fast enough to not catch his reflection in the looking glass. He was indeed very handsome, just as her cousins said, but what really attracted her in his face was this look of caring affection. He smiled to her in the mirror and she couldn’t help smiling back to him – a shy smile, expressed more by the eyes than the lips. Soon her veil was off her head and safely placed on the sofa and she stood up to her husband, not because she felt like doing it, but because she thought she was supposed to do it. He squeezed her arm lightly and she called to her heart, <em>Come on! Open up! It’s time!,</em> As her husband took her by the hands she followed him to sit on the edge of the bed. Bravely she lifted her eyes and looked in his handsome face with a smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You know I fell in love with this smile” he confessed. ”I’ve seen you so many times walking in the market with your mother, I’ve seen you in the uni, even though you might have not seen me – you never really looked in my direction. And I’ve seen your smile and I fell in love with it. I fell in love with you. So I asked my father to ask yours for your hand in marriage and when he said yes I was – I still am – the happiest man in the world! My beautiful bride.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He stroked her chin as she looked at him in disbelief. A love marriage! How could that be! Yet this love – this silly passion putting unnecessary strain on the heart – proved not only to be irrational but also contagious. Because Noreen felt dizzy from emotions and this dizziness, she forgot all her principles. Her heart’s door was wide open and she no longer cared that her husband loved her because she loved him, as well!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="page" title="Page 68">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">A boy came up to me today. He said, “Please, give me some money.” I looked down into those light pools of innocence and my hand that was about to wave him away stilled. “I don’t have any money with me,” I said, feeling bad. He would not let me be, and we walked together for a bit. Him asking, and me telling him that he should not be begging.</div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>

<div class="page" title="Page 68">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We crossed the road. “Where is your mummy?” I asked. He pointed her out on the other side, carrying a baby in front of the masjid with hand outstretched. I have seen her many times, wearing the hijab. The imam told us that they were Christians and their men have been seen idling their time in cafes while they send their women and kids out to beg. “Tell your mummy not to make you ask people for money, it is not right. Where is your daddy?”</p>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t know where my daddy is.”</p>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a café? Or perhaps dead? Maybe they were Bosnians. Maybe his daddy was one of the many thousand Muslim men murdered in the Bosnian-Sebian war? I watched him as he answered me. He said it like he was telling me that the grass is green. Then he looked unsure.</p>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My heart could not say no. I don’t think I could the first moment we met. I told him he had to come with me as I had to go and get the money because I didn’t have any on me. He asked where and I pointed to the shop up ahead, a few feet away. He said ok. I asked him to wait for me outside the shop and that I would be back. He said okay. He trusted me. Or maybe he didn’t have anything to lose. But I think it is the former. He is only about seven; I refuse to believe that he has lost his trust in people.</p>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran up the stairs to get some money from my purse. A few coins, might have added up to £2. I did not want to give him the £5 note I had. Thought that would do more harm than good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not want him to think that begging is good and that one did not need to work. As I ran back down I told Allah that I did not know if what I was doing was right or wrong, but to let this act of mine be one he would remember through the years and guide him to Islam when he grows up. I found him where I left him. My heart smiled.</p>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put the coins into the small palm. “Thank you,” he said. And he was grateful. I placed my hand on his shoulder and looked him seriously in the face. “You must not beg, it is not right.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“When you grow up, you must work okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“You must not ask people to give you money.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“You must use your two hands and work for the money, then you will be happy.” I tried to tell him as simply as I could in our brief encounter. Looking at him, I did not want to let him go.</p>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to instil in him that principle of life. I wanted to teach him all of life’s lessons, about morality and ethics, about Allah and Islam. I wanted him to grow up to be an honourable man who led a meaningful life. His English was not good. I don’t know if he understood me. I pray he did. And that my words will stay with him.</p>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now sitting at my desk, I wonder if I should have bought him some chicken and chips instead of giving him the money. What if he never benefits from it and those men take it and spend it on haram things instead? Why did I not think of this earlier? I am angry with his mum for using him to beg. I am angry that they are making use of his innocence. I am angry that a child should be exposed to rejection and disgust. I am angry that he is made to humble himself in front of creation. I am angry that his little heart is on the line. But more than anything I am afraid that his soul will not be able to remain pure, that his innocence will disappear. I am afraid that he may grow up a good-for-nothing, a man who stretches out his hand to ask of people instead of Allah. I pray that I did not help him along the way with my deed.</p>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea"></div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that his face and the sweet innocent way he looked at me will be with me for some time. I hope that his life will be filled with many blessings from Allah. I sincerely pray that Allah will guide him and make him grow up strong and brave, a man with a straight back, walking on the straight path.</p>

doctors speak c]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Close your eyes, relax and send your mind to a place where the stale, pungent aromas of the critically ill flow through the veins of the hospital. Let your mind wander through the dull, grey corridors and open spaces of the wards and the hospital grounds. You hear the first yell from a newborn, the last breath of the dying, the exhausted sighs of the doctors and nurses as they make their way to their next rounds. Welcome to South Africa and Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fondly called Bara, it is a specialist referral hospital providing curative services for +3.5 million people from the southern and western parts of Gauteng with referrals from surrounding African countries as well. If all the corridors in the hospital were put into a straight line it will be more than 10 kilometres long. The hospital was entered in the 1997 Guinness Book of Records as the largest hospital in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #109e9e;"><span style="color: #2ca9f2;">“It is a hands-on learning experience under the worst of conditions. For anyone else, walking through the hospital can make you feel repulsed as the sights and smells can be intense. As a doctor you learn to use your nose as a tool to diagnose certain illnesses.&#8221;</span><br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The Casualty, Emergency and Outpatient Unit is the busiest section of the hospital. Here they receive about 350 patients per day, which could easily double over a weekend. Approximately 70 per cent of the cases handled, in the emergency departments, are trauma related. If anyone still thinks that medicine is a glamorous profession, one day in the blood and gore at Bara will quickly dispel that myth. But it is here that Muslim doctors in Johannesburg cut their medical teeth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #2ca9f2;"><strong>Young Intern Finding a Balance </strong></span><br />
Dr Razinah Mamdoo (25) from Johannesburg is doing her second year internship at Bara and is currently completing her rotation in family medicine. Coming from a family of doctors, she was exposed to medicine from a young age and lists her father as her major source of inspiration: “I have always admired my father, he loves his job and I went with him as a child and watched him work. I decided at a young age that medicine was my calling but as I grew up I thought I should explore other avenues. I started studying chemical engineering and for the first week I was utterly miserable. I knew my calling was medicine and decided to embrace my chosen path.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Razinah says of working at Bara: “You are exposed to everything. It is a hands-on learning experience under the worst of conditions. For anyone else, walking through the hospital can make you feel repulsed as the sights and smells can be intense. As a doctor you learn to use your nose as a tool to diagnose certain illnesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
“I remember when I had to certify my first death. It was difficult but I found that our deen provides us comfort in death so I read the dua ‘to Allah do we belong and to Him will we return.’ Immediately I felt calm, that life and death are not in our hands. I find that my Iman allows me to cope and to accept Allah’s will.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
According to Razinah, Muslimah doctors have an advantage as they are given a lot of respect and have the opportunity to practise their deen. At Bara there is a strong Islamic presence and Muslim organisations such as the Muslim Students Association provide a good support structure for Muslim students, interns and doctors. She finds that wearing the hijab only strengthens and uplifts the status of a Muslim woman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
“My purpose is to help people as best as I can. I love what I do and enjoy the challenges that each day brings. The reward for me and most doctors at the end of the day is a grateful smile and the hope that they will remember you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Razinah’s message to women is to try and create a good, healthy balance in life without segregating one from the other. For Razinah, Islam is all about incorporating your personality, goals, morals and values to strike a balance in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #2ca9f2;"><strong>Specialisation: Multi-tasking and Juggling</strong> </span><br />
Dr Ayesha Wadee graduated with her Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBCH) at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1998. She married her husband while still finding her feet in her new profession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I grew up in a very conservative family. Most women in our family were forced to leave school by grade 9 to get married and start a life as a mother and homemaker. That a woman could have both a career and marriage was taboo. My parents asked me to choose a career where I could be self sufficient and not dependent on anyone like a boss. In my heart I knew medicine was my life’s calling after visiting a hospital while still in high school and spending time with doctors. My father supported my decision to complete my schooling and further my education.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ayesha began specialising in internal medicine, but the road to completing her specialisation was interrupted with giving birth to and meeting the needs of her two young children. “Not long after we were married we went through a very rough financial period making me the sole breadwinner.  I worked as a medical officer to guarantee a stable income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
“After my husband found work I began my specialising again until my second child was born. I resigned for a few months to work in a private practice but soon returned to Bara. The nights and overtime took a toll on my family life. The children were babies so it did not impact them that hard but as they grew, their needs grew with them. Last year I made a decision to prioritise my family and stopped night work. I am on a roster basis on weekends and emergencies.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Ayesha is super specialising in rheumatology. A specialty which usually takes two years to complete will take Ayesha longer as she has to balance family life and a career. Fortunately, the hospitals allow doctors with family commitments time to complete their studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
“Islam and my faith in Allah, alhamdulillah, mapped out my life. There are days when it is a challenge to find time to fit salah in, but this is essential even when it seems almost impossible. In Ramadhan you carry a date and water with you while working; you break your fast and try and perform your salah.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Like Razinah, Ayesha has found that there is a mutual respect when you are in hijab, or even niqab, between the patients and colleagues. She says that there is a silent understanding amongst the Muslim doctors that if a female Muslim doctor is uncomfortable treating a male patient, she will refer the patient to a male Muslim doctor and vice versa. The Muslim medical staff tries its best to accommodate each other and maintain an Islamic atmosphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
“I feel sad for our Muslim women here who fight their way into Medical School only to leave everything for marriage. There is nothing wrong with women having a career as long as we remember that we are Muslims and our allegiance is to Allah first. We are women and we can try and balance our life with passion, nurturing life as it unfolds in front of us. Our lives are in Allah’s hands.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em><span style="color: #999999;">Zaytoon Akhalwaya Abed (32) is the daughter of an anti-apartheid activist and journalist. Like her father, she has embraced writing as her passion, particularly those themes that focus on uplifting Muslim women and children. She lives in Johannesburg with her husband and two children.</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One moment of clarity,<br />
Engraved in my memory,<br />
Two paths unfurled before me,<br />
Who will I be?<br />
The girl I am now,<br />
So young and carefree?<br />
Living the life,<br />
Or so it seems.<br />
Inside I am empty,<br />
Despite how hard I try,<br />
With temporary joys!<br />
To fill the void.<br />
In this moment I see clearly,<br />
Fun and laughter,<br />
Sun and Sand,<br />
Exotic indulgences,<br />
Wealth, career plans<br />
But my breast is heavy,<br />
My purpose unknown,<br />
Deep down inside,<br />
I still feel alone.<br />
In the same moment I see,<br />
Hard work and struggles,<br />
The glitter is gone,<br />
Steady and settled,<br />
Less of the fun.<br />
But more of the meaning,<br />
My mind is still<br />
The hole in my life,<br />
It has been filled.<br />
I am mother and wife,<br />
Steady and strong,<br />
I have a family where I belong.<br />
The ummah is with me and me with them,<br />
As I worship Allah,<br />
I am a Muslim.<br />
My chest is light,<br />
My burdens are lifted,<br />
My soul satisfied.<br />
My priorities shifted.<br />
No need to please others.<br />
Only Allah.<br />
In this is the best reward by far.<br />
That’s what I saw, in front of my eyes, so real, so clear.<br />
A fork in the road,<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Camile Bannon* shares how converting to Islam changed a loving father-daughter relationship. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="color: #99cc00;">“We should strive to maintain excellent kinship bonds and forgive the shortcomings of our relatives for the sake of Allah, in hope that He may forgive our shortcomings. The sacred bonds of blood must never be severed. One of the greatest of the major sins is filial impiety, which is prevalent in modern society. Relationships are a trial from Allah…”</span> <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Agenda to Change Our Condition &#8211; H.Yusuf and Z. Shakir)</span> </em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a child, when I was in big trouble my mother used to say to me, “You are your father’s daughter!” It was no compliment, but I didn’t care. I idolised my father and was proud to be compared to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to be the son he never had. We played catch, watched sports, collected baseball cards, and did lots of other things that fathers and sons tend to do. I wore football jerseys and baseball caps with two long braids. He called me “Tiger,” “Ace,” and “Sport.” It wasn’t until my early twenties that I realised that he could not fix all things with one phone call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
He recently visited me and my family. The usual once-a-year, less than 24-hour visit that he feels obligated to do. One of my little girls asked him to play a game. He simply said “No.” No explanation or niceties, and nothing to appease her little soul. I’ll never forget the smile disappearing from her face. No-one, not even strangers, had ever talked to her so coldly. Later that day she grabbed onto his leg, hugging it as tightly as she could. He told her that he had a bad knee and to let go. I thought my heart would break when she reached up to grab his hand as we were walking. He reluctantly allowed her to hold his hand after much insistence on her part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The annual obligatory visit has always been painful for me &#8211; not so much because of the obvious disdain he has for me and my chosen path, but because it makes me remember how close we used to be. But in the last few years, his visits had become far more difficult. It is one thing bearing the brunt of someone’s anger; it is quite another thing watching your children become the targets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew becoming a Muslim was not going to go over well with my atheist father. I was taught religion was for fools and the weak. All that he ever wanted for me was to have a successful law career, marry a doctor, play tennis, and spend my summers poolside at the country club. But life unfolded much differently than both of us could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember the first time I read the verses in a translation of the Qur’an, which instruct us to obey our parents except when they try to make us associate partners with Allah, glorified and exalted is He. It was literally a God-send. I realised that my praise and duty was to Allah (SWT), freeing me from the fear of my father’s disapproval. Reading the verses gave me the strength to say the Shahada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years since I converted, I have endured his many anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim remarks. I have tried to return his comments with what is better although I have not always succeeded. I ignored the more offensive comments and changed the subject. I asked him politely not to speak so disparagingly about our beloved Prophet (SAW). For years, he told me that he hoped that I was a “spy” and not really a Muslim. When he realised that I truly believed what I professed, he apparently decided to let go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been mourning the loss of my father for a long time now. I have often thought to tell him that he no longer needs to keep up the masquerade &#8211; that I release him of all fatherly obligations. But recently I read a book that made me realise that I have obligations to my father regardless of his behaviour towards me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father helped to raise, educate, and protect me. Allah (SWT) put us together for a reason. I must not sever filial ties but try to mend them &#8211; even if my father would prefer I let him go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Understanding my duty is bringing me a strange sense of peace. I am trying to maintain a relationship with him for the sake of Allah and not because I expect my father to reciprocate. Admittedly, it is not easy when he is so disinterested in my life and my family. I also pray often that my father returns to Allah as a Muslim surrendering and with a sound heart. Indeed, no one knows who will die a friend of Allah, the All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My girls and I walk my father to his car. “Pop! Pop! Can’t you stay longer?” They yell as they run to hug him goodbye. His body stiffens and he turns his head as they try to kiss him. <strong>I want to cry and scream but I remain silent, remembering my duty.</strong> His car drives away and he does not look back. We turn to walk inside. The sun peeks through the dark clouds and warm rays shine brightly on our faces. One of my little girls turns to me and says “Thank you, Allah, for the beautiful sun.” She smiles and runs off with her sister. I smile too. Indeed, all praise and gratitude is for Allah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hend Hegazi addresses the pandemic issue Muslim mums fail their sons on...]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day a post on my Facebook newsfeed from an Islamic inspirational site showed an image with a couple facing each other, the woman looking up to her husband, her head tilted to the side. The caption encouraged wives to use this “subordinate” position for apologising to their husbands, claiming that it shows vulnerability and “gives the message that you are indeed sorry for your actions.” It had my blood boiling!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are women being taught this seductive manner of apologising? Do we err so often that a simple “I’m sorry” has become insincere? Or is it because our egos make it difficult for us to voice an apology? In my opinion, not only are both theories nonsense, but both are much more true about men. Men are the ones who tend to have issues asking for forgiveness, so why do we not see similar posts geared towards them? Where are the posts that encourage men to be the first to reconcile, even if it is simply to maintain peace in the home? You won’t easily find such posts, and here’s why: while we spend so much time teaching our daughters how to be good wives, no one takes the time to teach our sons how to be good husbands. We teach our daughters to maintain order in her home so that her husband is comfortable. We teach them that when there is a problem, she shouldn’t approach her husband as soon as he comes home after work. Rather, she should wait until after she feeds him, makes his tea and runs his bath. We teach them that when he is angry, it is best for her to stay quiet until he calms down, before explaining her point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I do not disagree with these methods, I am disheartened that the same advice is not passed on to our sons. We rarely say to them, “When you see your wife frustrated, don’t just leave the room to avoid her; try to comfort her, even if you think her reasons for being angry are unjustified.” No one says, “If you pull yourself off the couch to get a snack or something to drink, offer to get her the same.” No one says, “Sometimes she just needs you to be there… really be there.” No one says, “There are a million ways to show her you care, and even though it will take some effort to find which she likes best, you do have to do it.”No one teaches them the importance of fulfilling their wives sexually. No one says any of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are we always teaching our daughters how to be wives when we almost never teach our sons how to be husbands? Why do we not give our daughters this same courtesy? The sad truth is, no one cares. No one cares what kind of husband he will be; shy of physical abuse (and even then, sometimes they still don’t seem too concerned), he can be the worst husband in the world, but it’s up to his wife to suck it up and provide him with a happy home no matter how unhappy his careless treatment makes her. The bottom line of this double standard is that we give husbands the right to be neglectful, and then when the marriage falls apart, the wife is blamed for being unable to keep it together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we care about the wellbeing of our daughters and of the Ummah overall, we must spend more time advising our sons that their role in the home plays a significant part in its atmosphere. We must explain to them repeatedly that their responsibilities go far beyond just the financial aspect. We must ingrain in them &#8211; just as we do to our daughters &#8211; their spiritual and emotional duties as a spouse. Studies show that children whose mothers are happy are themselves better adjusted and happier, leading to increased happiness in adulthood as well. But where does that wife’s happiness come from? If her husband neglects her, caring only about his own satisfaction, whether that be emotionally or intimately, there is no way she will be able to find happiness. If he expects her to carry the full load of child-rearing and act as though he is not responsible, this, too, will have a negative effect on her, and consequently, on the entire household.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, however, we teach our sons how to communicate with their wives &#8211; complement her on how she looks, express pride about a professional accomplishment she has achieved, show appreciation for the warm cooked meals she provides, embrace her when she’s sad or frustrated, talk to her about things which are occupying your attention, spend time with her where you are fully present, etc. &#8211; then we give them the communication skills which are essential in making their marriage successful. By putting as much effort into teaching our sons how to be good husbands as we do to teaching our daughters how to be good wives, I have no doubt that divorce rates would decrease and there would be a sharp increase in the overall happiness in our homes. Many people are familiar with the hadith in which ‘Aishah (RA) states that Prophet Muhammad (SAW) “used to keep himself busy serving his family and when it was the time for prayer he would go for it.&#8221; We must emphasise this in our homes, to our sons, and encourage them to emulate Rasool Allah (SAW) in all his actions, including his treatment to his family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong; I’m not saying that we should not teach our daughters, nor am I saying that we should not advise each other about how to improve ourselves as wives. Not at all. We must teach our daughters and continue to advise each other because marriage takes work. All I’m saying is that we need to make certain that our sons understand that marriage takes work from both parties. They must learn early on that just because women are more inclined to give in a relationship does not absolve men from giving; wives have desires and emotional needs for which their husbands are responsible. But the true advantage of being a husband is that the more he gives, the more he’ll get back. The happier he makes his wife, the more eager she will be to please him. Marriage is very much a positive feedback system; while both members give, the system produces more love and happiness. If one member slacks for a while, the system will continue to run, but only for a limited time. If either member doesn’t exert the required energy for extended periods of time, the system will fail. Honestly, it’s that simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forgive me for having generalised throughout this rant; I know that there are many men out there who genuinely strive to fulfill their wives’ sexual and emotional needs, but the truth is, these are the minority. I pray that these men will serve as role models for all of the boys in their lives, teaching them through example how to be proper husbands. I pray that all mothers will manage to recruit their husbands so that together they can put increased effort into teaching their sons that a successful marriage requires both parties to fulfil the needs of the other. May Allah (SWT) bless our husbands and guide them to be the comfort their wives desire, just as Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was for his wives. And may He (SWT) bless our children and help us to raise them to be righteous spouses, always striving to comfort their partners.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ann (Umameer) Stock finds that with much du’a, dreams of studying Qur’an abroad came through for one tenacious sister.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Umm Ayyoub was born into a Muslim family but woke up to her religion when she entered university. Prior to that, she thoughtlessly went through the motions of being a Muslim. She had attended Qur’an memorisation lessons, yet she found herself struggling to even read Surah An-Nas properly. Refusing to accept her situation, Umm Ayyoub decided she wanted to turn her life around.  She began to study about Islam in detail, though her family didn’t see why. When her father passed away, it was a turning point.  They needed her knowledge to cope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She continually made du’a to Allah to open her doors for learning perhaps travelling abroad and studying at Um Al Qura University in Mecca. After years of du’a, Allah (SWT) was about to deliver His plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A young man came to her family interested in marriage. Umm Ayyoub by this time had finished teacher training and was doing on-the-job training. She had clear cut goals: “I had certain boxes that had to be ticked,” said Umm Ayyoub “and they were almost all Islamic-based.” The young man sat quietly while Umm Ayyoub outlined her plans for studying. At that point she wanted to study everything: Qur’an, fiqh, aqeedah. After she finished her presentation, he didn’t ask any questions and left. She wondered if that was good sign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She prayed Salat Al-Istikharah, asking Allah (SWT) for whatever was best. The young man later told Umm Ayyoub that he didn’t ask questions because he liked everything he had heard. After she accepted his proposal, he was offered jobs abroad and asked her to choose from them. She chose Saudi Arabia. To this day he continues his unwavering support. May Allah (SWT) reward him for each and every letter she learns and teaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to marriage, Umm Ayyoub had never been away from her close-knit family. In Jeddah she was alone without friends. Everything was strange. She didn’t know her way around, and Saudi was not the Islamic Utopia she was expecting. She cried a lot at first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her biggest mistakes were not finding a support group straight away or investigating options for studying in Jeddah. Um Al Qura in Makkah proved to be too far away. “The first year was experimental,” she says. Eventually she found Dar El Huda, an excellent tajweed school with a section for non-Arab women. She went from two nights a week to intensive daytime studies the following year. It changed her life. She will be attending level 4 next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning tajweed is hard work but her recitation has completely improved. She has also completed a course in Qaa’idah an-Nooraaniyyah (an Arabic reading proficiency technique) and due to her high marks, will join their training program for teachers. She aspires to get her ijaza for the memorisation of the Jazariyyah (a lengthy Arabic poem containing all of the tajweed rules) and memorising the entire Qur’an.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focusing on Qur’an instead of several different areas of study was what she did right. “Qur’an is our main source of guidance, focusing on it has been one of the best things I have ever done,” says Umm Ayyoub.  Also, she discovered that studying while single was easier than after marriage. But it was also easier with a new baby rather than being pregnant and constantly feeling sick. “You never get more time you only get less,” says Um Ayoub, “so don’t delay!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) answered her du’a beyond her dreams. She has a supportive husband and like-minded supportive friends. Umm Ayyoub feels that she has a responsibility to return to England and spread the knowledge to her community. “It wouldn’t be right if I just stayed home and kept this all to myself. Allah would ask me why I hadn’t shared my gift.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em><span style="color: #999999;">Ann (Umameer) Stock reverted to Islam 27 years ago and lives back and forth between Cairo and Jeddah with her Egyptian husband. The Middle East has been home for over 24 years. She has seven children and eight grandchildren &#8211;  Alhamdulillah.</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SubhanAllah, in 2011 I was blessed with the opportunity to perform Umrah again, this time during the sacred month of Ramadhan! Umrah is an amazing experience, and for anyone considering going, I would sincerely encourage going for it in Ramadhan! Contrary to expectations, performing Umrah during Ramadhan was a totally different and heightened experience altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I was completely dumbfounded. Before, whilst watching pilgrims praying their salah in the Haram, I would be baffled as to why people would opt to pray outside of the Haram as oppose to as close to the Ka&#8217;bah as possible. Now I understood. As it was Ramadhan, swarms of people had made their way to the two holy cities seeking rewards from Allah (SWT) likely knowing that it had been narrated that the Prophet (SAW) said “When the month of Ramadan arrives, go for ‘umrah, because `umrah in Ramadan is like accompanying me on Hajj.” <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Bukhârî)  </span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One vivid memory I carry is that of performing the Sa&#8217;ee between Safa and Marwa. I was beyond thirsty and my Dad was searching for a functioning Zamzam tap in the middle of the two walkways. Understandably the taps had been switched off during the fasting hours, but we just wanted to splash water on ourselves for some relief. This was quite amazing in itself. No access to water made for a more literal re-tracing of the steps that Hajar (RA) took while desperately searching for water for the prophet Isma&#8217;il (AS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I better remembered that whenever I felt some sort of coolness or mysterious spray of water, that this was Allah&#8217;s (SWT) mercy. I was also more thankful than I had ever been for the rainy weather we are accustomed to in Britain. Alhamdulillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During iftar time in Medina, my sister and I had brought little food with us besides dates and were seated on a prayer mat above the burning hot floor outside of the mosque of the beloved Rasool (SAW). Although in both of the holy mosques, each and every day there were people distributing bread, yogurt, cups of Zamzam, dates and more, I especially remember a beautiful family that had settled themselves on a large, thick, prayer mat sharing food and drink with each other a couple of centimetres away from us. The beautiful thing about this family was that they were so loving and generous that, by the will of Allah (SWT), they made a plate for us, consisting of chickpeas, salad and pilau rice. Not only did they offer us delicious food, but after the men in the family had moved, we were invited to pray with the sisters on their prayer mat. May Allah (SWT) reward this family, and all of the other generous Muslims we encountered, for their kindness, insha Allah. The sheer amount of generosity of food put into perspective the true unity in this Ummah, and how it breaks the barriers of language and race just to stand side by side to worship our Creator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, this Ramadhan will always have a special place in my heart. Sharing my experience with you right now has opened the gate to many good memories. I pray that I return soon, insha Allah, and that I have been able to reveal even a glimpse of this amazing time which I encourage you all to try to attain.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Brooke Benoit addresses the prevailing problem of couples sloppily dishing out ignorance. 
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Well my husband told me that it’s haram to…” she starts in, causing a self-preserving mist to cover my ears as soon as she emitted “my husband.”  It would sound like a hyperbole if I tried to estimate how many times I have heard sisters refer to their husbands as religious authorities. I mean their non-sheikh, Average Jamal husbands. Worse is how many times they were simply, flat out wrong. Her husband heard something from a brother who knew a guy who read a blog post about a video… and their telephone game ended with the opposite meaning of the ruling I had just recently read in supposedly the same fatwa. Yes, the same issue, the same sheikh &#8211; totally different interpretation of what he said! So what happened? Unlike the meticulous rulings and writings we have access to, when this information is casually handed about something vital is often lost. ‘Lost in Interpretation’ we can call it, but unfortunately we &#8211; my friend, her husband, the friend and the fatwa &#8211; were all speaking the same language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A husband’s obligation to foster his wife’s religious education is one of the many things I liked about Islam before I converted. A husband’s holistic support &#8211; I wanted in on that! Across cultures and religions there are maxims such as “To educate a man is to educate an individual. To educate a woman is to educate a nation” and of course Islam confirms this with the recognition of the mother as primary and pivotal teachers for their children. But why then, with so much careful attention given to chains of narrations and our appreciation of the purity of the Qur’an, do we toss all that fiqh (etiquette) out the window when it comes to learning from the ones closest to us? “Well I trust my husband!” the sister snips at me when I ask if her husband provided her with some <em>daleel</em> (proof).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) said: &#8220;All of you are shepherds and all of you will be asked about your wards. The ruler is a shepherd and shall be asked about his wards. The man is a shepherd of his family and will be asked about his ward.&#8221; (<span style="color: #999999;"><em>Bukhari)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This casualness that can exist between spouses is&#8230; no casual matter! It reminds me of the statistic that the majority of automobile accidents happen near your home, where you are most familiar with the surroundings and likely to let your guard down. Maybe, sis, you aren’t being slack about how you accept crucial knowledge from your “habibi” (baby). I’ll provide another excuse. And maybe this doesn’t even apply to you or your husband, but it may be useful to know one of the many ways that the good knowledge-sharing link can be broken.  Studies have indicated that in the US 14% of all adults are functionally illiterate, meaning they can phonetically read, but do not critically understand what they are reading. The 2009 Human Development Report estimated that 20% of the US population lacked functional literacy, they estimated 21.8% of the population for the UK. Wherever you live and read, I caution you to watch your back, sisters &#8211; that brother or sister who always seems to have a book tucked under their arm could be that one out of five, if you or your husband aren’t…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time your hubby tells you that something is haram, or just orally relates anything new to you in our glorious religion try this: bat your eyes at him lovingly and breathlessly exclaim, “Oh my dear. That is so interesting. You must show me your sources, honey!” Then cuddle up with your husband over a book (or app), expand your knowledge and get your worship on!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Nadia Ali illustrates the beauty of Ramadhan among the ummah of her new home in Trinidad.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Ramadhans used to be filled with encouragements to share our values, generosity and kindness with our non-Muslim neighbours and acquaintances, but how is it to practice Ramadhan in a neighbourhood where nearly everyone is Muslim? This is the life I now surprisingly lead on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It is definitely a far cry from the block of flats where we used to live in South East London!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approximately 78,000 Muslims live in Trinidad and Tobago. Because of its geographical location, the fasting timetable remains more or less constant throughout the years, generally beginning fasting at 4:30am and ending around 6pm. In Trinidad the fasting day begins in darkness, amid the sound of the night time chorus of crickets, frogs and other insects. Breezes rustle through the nearby palm and coconut trees, while stars twinkle above the vast sugar cane fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The night that we stand on our back porch looking for the sliver of moon to commence the sacred month, we can hear the laughter of children and the muffled conversations of our neighbours in the street. If we miss the sighting, we can always check the Islamic Broadcast Network (IBN), a local Muslim TV station. IBN confirms the start of Ramadhan in conjunction with the Darul Uloom Trinidad and Tobago Moonsighting Committee. Once announced, the brothers on our street, decked out in jubas (gowns) and topee (hats), can be seen heading to the mosque for the first taraweeh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the rest of the country sleeps, lights go on and toes touch the bedroom floor to make their way to the kitchen for suhoor. There is not a typical local meal that people have for pre-fasting. Those who like fruits generally opt for local fruits of watermelon or papaya, roti is often preferred and in my household it’s a case of cereals, toast and tea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peering through the window at 3:30 am I can see the lights on in the houses of my Muslim neighbours, including Zalina, Nazma, Aisha, Sauda, Saleema, Aneesah and Naila. SubhanAllah! It is indeed a blessing to have many Muslims living on our street, providing comfort, security and warmth as a Muslim community, especially during Ramadhan. Often before dusk, the phone will ring, with a sister saying, “Assalamu ‘alaikum, I am sending something for you, insha Allah.” And soon someone is at our gate with food to enhance the breaking of our fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wait to hear the adhan called from the neighbourhood mosque to break our fast or we can tune into the radio or TV for confirmation. Special Ramadhan radio programmes are hosted in the early morning before dawn and in the evening before sunset, consisting of Islamic information, nasheeds and reminders of the niyyat (intention) to start/end the fast. We also watch live coverage from Makkah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Trinidad, we don’t go very far to get to the nearest mosque, ours is within walking distance and three more are a 10-minute drive away. There are about 85 mosques nationwide, most designed with large central domes, tall slender minarets and ornate archways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The mosques are especially well attended this month, with “Ramadhan mubarak” being heard throughout the neighbourhood.  Some mosques spread their iftars on the floor, whereas others provide dining hall settings. The Muslim business community organises the provision of water, drinks or dates. A typical plate that is served includes a date, samosa or potato/chicken pie, seasoned boiled channa and pholourie (pronounced po-lor-ree) which is a savoury fried split pea dough served with a sweet-peppery chutney. Drinks are juice, water and some mosques offer tea, ginger tea or coffee. For those remaining at home, IBN televises a delayed recording from earlier mosque iftars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the end of Ramadhan, the government will announce a public holiday to observe ‘Eid-ul–Fitr. Immediately after the official sighting, the nearby mosque will light up the sky with a half-hour of dazzling fireworks after ‘Isha. “‘Eid mubarak!” we say, as we unite with our Muslim neighbours, family and friends around the world in observing the joyous festival of ‘Eid–ul-Fitr.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s something cathartic about a storm,<br />
As if the heavens had imbued<br />
All the torment and misery of this world<br />
Into dark, nebulous clouds<br />
And reached a rumbling rage<br />
Pain that could no longer be contained &#8211;<br />
Like tears, it only takes an unchecked trickle<br />
For the torrent to cascade<br />
Cold, wet ice stones strike<br />
Parched and inflamed souls,<br />
Cooling, soothing, refreshing<br />
The sky roars and weeps<br />
Until all is purged again</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this final chapter of Hafsah Zamir’s not-so-fairy-tale, will Samiah’s brother find a man good enough to make Samiah break h]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sajid didn’t waste any time arranging a meeting with his friend after Samiah begrudgingly agreed to it. Two days later she found herself with Sajid, walking towards the restaurant where they were to meet Amer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This feels like a blind date,” Samiah said, trying to hide her nerves. “When did you transform into Cilla Black?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s a chaperoned dinner date,” Sajid corrected her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Date is the operative word,” she replied drily. She felt overdressed. She had spent longer getting dressed that evening than she would ever admit to. She had changed outfits approximately six times, more if you counted the number of times she changed her underwear to make sure it wasn’t visible through her dress. Her wardrobe had regurgitated its entire contents onto the bed and floor in an attempt at putting together an outfit appropriate for a dinner-date-rishta-meeting-thing. Nevertheless, six outfit changes later, she still felt uncomfortable and kept pulling her blazer together to cover herself. At thirty-one years old, she felt ridiculously like a teenager on her first date: she’d met dozens of men and been confident, cold even, about the whole process, but somehow this felt entirely new, almost alien.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Just relax, sis; you look fine.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was annoyed with herself for showing her nerves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sajid chose a restaurant a little out of town so she wouldn’t come across the prying eyes of anyone who might know her in the local community. The walk to the restaurant was only a few minutes but felt like mile-long trek and not only because her shoes were uncomfortable. She remembered how nervous she had been for her first ever rishta, but that had been excitement – this felt more like terror. She felt sick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Saj, I can’t do this.” She stopped and grabbed his arm. Panic rose in her chest: “Please take me home, I can’t do this!” She tried to hide her shaking hands. Sajid tried to calm her, told her to stop talking and take deep breaths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What the hell is wrong with me?” Frustrated tears pricked her eyes. “This is not me. Why are you making me do this? I told you that I can’t do this anymore. You all won’t stop until I lose my sanity.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sajid sat her down on a nearby bench and went to find her a bottle of water. When he returned, her eyes were dry and determination had returned. “I am not going to get married,” she declared. “Ever. I’m going to be like Elizabeth I. The Virgin Queen.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What?” Sajid looked so taken aback he didn’t know what to say. “Are you drunk?” Realising what he’d just said, he shoved the bottle under her nose: “Shut up and drink this.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Half a bottle later and when her hands were steadier, Sajid said: “No, this is not you. You are going to take control. You’re going to throw out all that rishta baggage from your mind and you are going to be that confident and proud and incessantly annoying woman that I know you are. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time she had had the pleasure of a dinner date was when her mother had blackmailed her into meeting someone who refused to attend a traditional rishta meeting at her house. Her mother had been too desperate to care about traditional protocol anymore. Naveed wore a shirt that was far too tight and had one too many buttons undone beneath the collar. His hair was slicked back with what appeared to be the entire contents of a hair gel tub. He also talked far too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the first half hour, Naveed said to her dismissively: “You’re not really my type, but I think we may as well give it a go &#8211; my mother really likes your type. Homely and all that.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was so disgusted she couldn’t speak, so she excused herself to go to the bathroom. Standing in front of the mirror, she calmed herself by smoothing her hijab and swiping a ferocious red lipstick across her angry mouth. Turning her heel, she marched back to the table to her where he sat waiting and said: “Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner, I might just have honoured you with more of my time.” She opened her purse, slammed down a twenty on the table and walked out. She was glad she had worn high heels, they added fire to her walk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moment she saw Amer &#8211; the moment he laid eyes on her &#8211; she knew this wouldn’t be like the last dinner date. He stood to greet them, smiled warmly, asked about their journey, if he could order them any drinks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He wasn’t particularly tall, nor was he distinctively handsome, but his hair was dark and there seemed a comforting softness about him. Within minutes, Samiah recognised a man who was humble and good natured. His voice was deep and quiet; he didn’t speak unnecessarily and yet he listened attentively and spoke to her often, as if there was nothing that she could say that might surprise him. Samiah’s nerves slipped away and, by the time the food arrived, it no longer felt like a date or even a rishta meeting, but more like meeting a new family friend on any normal, no-pressure day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, that didn’t mean that Samiah wouldn’t do what Samiah did best. So when Sajid excused himself to go to the bathroom, Samiah began to list her disclaimers: “Here’s the deal:  I’m not living with in-laws; I will not give up my job and will work for as many hours as I wish; I will have children when I feel like having children; I won’t be told how I should and shouldn’t dress -”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think you look great,” Amer interrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah was momentarily lost for words on being complimented and forgot the rest of the requirements on her list. So she said “You have no idea what Sajid has let you in for.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amer looked amused. “Saj said you might try to scare me off. You’re the shrew of the house, I hear.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This annoyed her. “So he hired you to tame me?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He smiled, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to starve you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She pretended not to be impressed with his knowledge of Shakespeare. “It’s unfair that Saj prepared you to meet me but I know nothing about you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He encouraged her to ask anything she wished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You seem like an intelligent person who is doing well for himself; you’re not hideous, you don’t look like an alcoholic or a drug addict. What’s the catch?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
He laughed, but wasn’t fazed by the directness of the question. He replied equally directly: “I was engaged to the wrong girl for longer than I should have been. Her family’s requirements became ludicrous, both emotionally and financially.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Why did you keep it up? Out of love?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, yes at first. But somewhere along the line I grew up. I didn’t break the engagement, despite no longer wanting to marry her, because I’d made a promise to her. It turned into a tug of war between her family and my own. In the end they broke the engagement themselves as they realised I couldn’t give them what they wanted and I wasn’t prepared to lose my family.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amer’s honesty impressed her and she felt that she didn’t need to ask him anything else – at least, not for the rest of the evening, which passed pleasantly. There was something strangely familiar and yet unfamiliar about him. She liked to hear him talk, the soft way he told stories and how he asked questions about her life and her work. Unlike many men that she had met previously, he seemed actually interested in knowing her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After dinner, Amer walked them to the car and, with Sajid’s permission, gave Samiah his business card: “I had a really nice evening and if you ever feel like you’d like to chat, then please do drop me a message.” For the first time in years, Samiah felt herself blush as she took the card from his hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
On the journey home, Samiah noted how calm she felt in comparison to her panic attack a few hours earlier. Somehow the world seemed gentler, more freeing. Sajid smiled at her knowingly but said nothing. Amer was not the product of her daydreams, but she was definitely onto something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, she sent him a text message. His response was almost instant. He was attentive, gentlemanlike and good humoured. Samiah felt silly and girly each time she spoke to him, although it was hardly the stuff of romance. She felt comfortable allowing her hard shell to slip away for this man who did not expect anything from her except to be herself: over the years she had become so accustomed to fighting for everything she believed in and projected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although she liked Amer better and better the more she got to know him, it became that much harder for Samiah to accept that she had found The One. How could she know that he was the right one? She had made that mistake in the past. Some nights she would stay awake for hours, thinking of all the reasons he might be wrong for her. But her only hesitation stemmed from the fact that he was not the kind of man she had always assumed that she would marry. However, that vision of the ideal man had been shattered long ago. Should she continue to seek a man who lived up to her dreams or marry a man that she had not realised could fit into her life – and heart – so effortlessly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Realising she could do no more except seek God’s counsel, she prayed for guidance for three consecutive nights. Her happiness was in His hands. After each night’s prayers, she felt that she could no longer go back to her old life after meeting Amer. And so, she finally gave Amer permission to speak to Sajid about arranging a family meeting. “Let’s allow the parents to take control from this point on,” Amer advised her. “Or let them think they have control,” laughed Samiah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was all happening so smoothly that Samiah felt the torture of the past eight years just wash away. She saw the same in her mother’s eyes when she told her about Amer. Her mother had lit up like a beacon, as if her life was once more worth living &#8211; that she was not, after all, a failed mother. This news was a gift from Samiah to her mother, possibly the most important gift that she might ever give her (though becoming a grandmother might trump it, but that could wait).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah wiped the tears of joy from her mother’s face. They had both fought this battle, sometimes together and sometimes opposing, but it now felt right that they celebrated together.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In a flash of fiction, Zainab Bint Younus reveals a time-worn dilemma.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>His dark eyes watched her from afar as she walked through the date orchard, his eyes shining with ardour, memorising every move. A small sigh escaped his lips, his beard rustling, a murmur of adoration. His heart ached, full and fierce, and he felt almost overpowered by his love for his wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>He loved her.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
She could feel his gaze on her, could feel the tug of his love for her; she lifted a shoulder in irritation, as though to shrug off the weight of his devotion the way she would brush off a fly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>She did not love him.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
He could feel her shudder of distaste when he brushed his fingertips along her skin, knew that she endured his embrace only out of dutifulness, but he couldn’t stop loving her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>He loved her.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
She had once loved him, long ago, but she didn’t know when it had faded to tolerance, then irritation, then something akin to hatred. His tenderness grated at her nerves; every glance, every caress, every word of love was a chain of slavery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>She did not love him.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
He clung to the long-ago memories of reciprocated love, of sweetness shared, of blissful moments. The words she spoke now, the disinterest of her gaze, the forced obedience of her actions, did not matter. All that mattered was that, once upon a time, she had loved him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>He loved her.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She did not loathe him; she pitied him for the helplessness of his love. She wished that his gaze would stray, that some other woman would snare his affection, be his wife in the way that he deserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>She did not love him.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Freedom. Finally. She rejoiced, rushing towards it with fervour and gratitude, without a moment’s backward glance at the man who adored her more than any other man could or ever would. She didn’t care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>She was free.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
His heart was broken, destroyed. His feet followed only her footsteps; his eyes saw only the woman who had been his wife, his beloved, even as she forsook him joyfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>He still loved her.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Ibn ‘Abbas narrated:<br />
<em>Barirah&#8217;s husband was a slave, who was known as Mughith. I can almost see him, running after her and weeping, with tears running down onto his beard. The Prophet said to `Abbas: `O `Abbas, do you not find it strange, how much Mugith loves Barirah and how much Barirah hates Mughith?&#8217;</em></p>
<p><em>The Prophet said (to Barirah), `Why do you not go back to him?&#8217;</em><br />
<em>She said, `O Messenger of Allah, are you commanding me to do so?&#8217;</em><br />
<em>He said, `I am merely trying to intervene on his behalf.&#8217;</em><br />
<em>She said, `I have no need of him.'&#8221; <span style="color: #999999;">(Sahih Bukhari)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Zainab bint Younus (AnonyMouse) is a hopeless romantic who, ironically enough, knows how Barirah must have felt like. When not brooding over the meaning of love and reading tragic romances, Zainab blogs at <a href="http://www.TheSalafiFeminist.blogspot.com." target="_blank">www.TheSalafiFeminist.blogspot.com.</a></em></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[In the third instalment of Hafsah Zamir’s series, our heroine may have to renege on her swearing off The Allied Rishta Forces an]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lubna’s wedding was only six weeks away and the planning was in full swing. As the specially selected maid of honour, Samiah was expected to be involved in every detail of her sister’s wedding plans, from the dress and makeup, to décor and wedding favours and even down to the cravat that her beloved Daniyal would wear. Lubna dragged Samiah into every Asian bridal shop across the south of England in search for her perfect outfit and the perfect bridesmaid’s dress for her sister. Samiah was also given the responsibility of organising her hen-do and her mendhi and the hundreds of gifts for the hundreds of relatives that Daniyal seemed to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Lubna to transform into a bridezilla and for Samiah to realise that her prestigious title of Maid of Honour was really only a guise for a personal assistant and that when Lubna would flutter her pretty lashes and say “how can I make any decisions without my big sister’s approval?” it was actually just Lubna’s way of getting Samiah to do things for her that Samiah would never have done otherwise. Of course, Samiah was pleased for her sister and was even willing to forgive Lubna’s insensitivity towards her own spinster status; so she helped wherever she could, lest she be accused of being jealous or bitter that her younger sister was getting married before her. She felt overstretched by all the organising on top of school reports and the looming exam period she was currently preparing for, but she could only pray to God to help her through this wedding without losing her sanity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from Lubna’s tantrums and other dramatic performances, when Samiah saw the joy that shone from Lubna’s pretty face, she couldn’t help but feel that, despite the trauma of the rishta search and manipulating her mother to call it all off, deep down she still wanted to get married. It was no longer a desire for steamy romance, but just for plain companionship. There was something disgustingly old and wise about this feeling and yet she welcomed it.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
There was an uneasy quietness to her mother ever since Samiah had bullied her into setting a date for Lubna’s wedding. Her mother’s sadness hurt Samiah but nothing that she said or did appeared to appease her. About a month before the wedding, she turned to her eldest daughter and said “If you had married Farhan like I had told you to, you wouldn’t have to watch your younger sister get married before you. But you were stubborn, like you always have been. Like your father”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pain and anger washed over Samiah but she said nothing and locked herself in her bedroom for the rest of the day. She had always been one to accept fate, never allowing herself to linger on mistakes, regrets, never pining for the past. There was safety in living in the moment. The Now. Not the past, not the future. It had always kept her going: there was freedom in only having the perspective of the next few steps ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Samiah’s mother would not let her forget what she had let go of. Each time the rishta search became particularly frustrating, she would say to Samiah: “You should have married Farhan.” Samiah knew that her mother only said this out of frustration, but somehow, this time, it felt worse because both Samiah and her mother had accepted defeat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had met Farhan at a Muslim marriage event. A friend had dragged her along after becoming fed up of the drama that came with the rishta Hunting Forces. She had even explored the world of matrimonial sites that had thousands of profiles from around the world with lists of biodata and mini personal statements, making it terribly easy to find what you were looking for. Although she had felt a little more in control in the online situation than relying on The Forces, it felt very much like online shopping and she gave up after she had encountered her fair share of weirdos, perverts and psychopaths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her friend had described this marriage event as “halal speed dating” and since anything seemed better than The Forces, Samiah had agreed to go. It wasn’t exactly what she had in mind when fantasising about the birth of a beautiful romance, but it was certainly a more efficient way of meeting a number of men in a shorter space of time. Certainly, it was better than being forced to spend the whole evening with a guy she would rather have closed the door on as soon as he had turned up at her doorstep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first half of the event had been not just tedious, but awkward and bizarre. It was like having a year full of blind dates all in one sitting. And the men she spoke to were actually no different to the ones that her mother had introduced her to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as the thought of sneaking out crossed her mind, a tall, darkish man sat down. He wasn’t particularly attractive, but there was so much character in his face. He said “I have no idea what I’m doing here.” She smiled for the first time that day and said “I think I was only meant to be here for moral support,” she nodded towards her friend who seemed to be having a better time than herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His smile was infectious, as was his banter. They spoke quickly, aware that they had only five minutes in which to encapsulate their whole lives. When the five minutes were up, he gave her his business card and made sure that he took her number: “I plan to bother you even if you don’t plan to bother me.” It was when he winked at her that Samiah knew she wanted to marry him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks they got to know each other. He was intelligent, charming, had a good job and there was more than enough chemistry between them. Religion was important enough to him to make Samiah feel that they could make it work, that they could learn and evolve together. Farhan seemed like a mouthful of clean water after being stranded in hot, nauseating desert air. She felt that this was fate – this was the man that God had kept for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six weeks after they met, they were already planning a wedding. Unfortunately that was also when Samiah’s vision of happily ever after began to show signs of cracking. Farhan’s mother was intrusive and controlling, making Samiah wonder if his mother even wanted her to marry her son. When she insisted that Samiah and Farhan live in the family house, despite the fact that there were already eight people living in the house, including the eldest son’s wife and two children, Samiah felt Farhan being slowly pulled away from her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Farhan himself asked her not to wear hijab for the first few weeks of their marriage that something between them snapped. “I want to the world to see how beautiful my wife is,” he smiled at her. “I want everyone to meet the real you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a moment Samiah was lost for words. Then she asked him how her hijab, a simple material covering her hair, could make her a different person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Your beauty is part of you”, he explained. “It perfects you – I want everyone to see you as I will see you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You want a trophy wife,” she said flatly. He looked surprised. “You want to show me off to your friends and relatives, to show them what you bagged – like a status symbol.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that-”<br />
“You want to expose my private space, which I’ve been preserving my whole life, just so that you can show off to your friends?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He didn’t understand her and she certainly did not understand him. Despite knowing her, Farhan clearly had no understanding of or respect for what hijab meant to her: her authority over her own body and mind. And this could be only a microcosm of what was to come in their marriage – and she couldn’t take that risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had to let Farhan go. He had been the best of all the men she had met, but he wasn’t enough. Thinking back, even now in this seemingly hopeless time, she could not imagine herself agreeing to compromise and marry Farhan. It would be like selling her soul. Wedding and living arrangements were temporary but she could not compromise her autonomy nor allow anyone to depreciate it. Her feelings for Farhan, or any man, were secondary to her own values, as were her age and desires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Samiah decided to pretend her mother hadn’t said what she had just said and instead busied herself with Lubna’s wedding preparation so she wouldn’t have to see her mother’s accusing face or reveal her own misery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days later, Samiah’s brother Sajid approached her again about his friend, promising her it had nothing to with their mother or sister. “C’mon Samiah, just meet him once – you’ve got nothing to lose.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s true,” she agreed, “I’ve already lost my pride and dignity, so yes you’re right, I have nothing left to lose.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Cut the sarcasm, sis; I know you’re miserable. Just meet him once. He’s a real nice guy. I guarantee you it won’t be anything like your rishta visits.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah felt her heart sink to her stomach. She didn’t want to be single forever but she would still have to go through the rishta meetings in order to find herself a husband. She had run out of excuses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t want mum or Lubna involved,” she complained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m not even going to tell them,” he assured her. “We can just go out for dinner, the three of us. We don’t even need to talk about marriage, just go out as friends.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah hesistated, unsure. “I’m too busy with the wedding.”</p>
<p>“C’mon, he’s really looking forward to meeting you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure if she could handle another meeting – it might just tip her off the edge. But through gritted teeth she said to her brother: “fine, I’ll meet him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Arwa Aburawa and Donna Frances Stacey address some Muslims’ ill attitudes and actions towards the environment.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In every person&#8217;s life, there are certain things they look back on and think, &#8216;Well, that was a bit of a disaster&#8217;. Maybe it was a teenage haircut you thought would make you look cool, a horror film you saw too young that still haunts you or a rush decision to buy 12 pairs of dungarees (everyone knows that they are a timeless purchase). Anyway, we will all look back and think, &#8216;My life could have probably done without that!&#8217; For me, it was finding out about climate change. Now I am not saying that it was the most depressing and spine-chillingly frightening horror I&#8217;ve ever discovered that the human race was inflicting on this planet, but it&#8217;s pretty high up on the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the real reason that I regret finding out about climate change and the devastating impacts it will have on this planet and its 7 billion person population is the often pitiful response it evokes from people, especially my smart, educated Muslim friends who should know better. I know, climate change is scary &#8211; it&#8217;s a problem of planetary scale, which in my book is pretty big. I know that climate change needs the whole world to get its act together &#8211; from homeschooling parents to corporations who are legally obliged to make their shareholders money &#8211; and do the right thing. I guess it is for this very reason, the almost impossibility of dealing with climate change, that many Muslims choose to simply ignore it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
They argue that it&#8217;s not their problem. That the Muslim Ummah has bigger problems to worry about. That the science isn&#8217;t solid proof and the weather is too hot/cold/rainy/dry anyway. That this a Western world issue. That they can&#8217;t change anything alone. That it&#8217;s too late. That it&#8217;s too early to take action. That it&#8217;s too hard, too unrewarding, too inaccessible, too complicated. That it&#8217;s the governments’ job or that the governments are failing and so what chance do we have?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To all those people who are making excuses to help avoid the action they know they need to take, I want to say that I feel your pain. I was in your shoes once and I know you&#8217;re desperate to avoid reality because it&#8217;s painful. But here&#8217;s something else you should know. There are things you can do &#8211; empowering things &#8211; and you&#8217;re not expected to save the world single-handedly. I do what I can &#8211; I limit my air travel, I limit my commute to work, I cycle, I&#8217;m careful with water, I don&#8217;t eat meat, I talk to Muslims about the environment and I celebrate and support businesses, individuals, groups, projects and organisations that are taking positive action to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, there are times when I feel hopeless because I know I&#8217;m not having a big enough impact and because the movement to pressure governments into action isn&#8217;t materialising. But I keep on going because denying reality isn&#8217;t the grown up thing to do. I also keep going because as a Muslim I have a duty to protect this amazing planet God created and because I have to show God that I am striving in whatever ways I can. When I think about Judgement Day, I think about the audacity of saying &#8220;Sorry, it was too hard and I never really understood the climate science&#8230; I was too busy on Facebook to dig the earth and plant it with food&#8230;. no-one else was doing anything and I was worried people would think I was weird.&#8221; Maybe we can say that now to each other but on the Day of Judgement would your lips be able to utter those words?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess what I really want to avoid is the Muslim Ummah looking back at our time on this earth and saying, &#8220;Well, that was a bit of a disaster&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Another Thing from Donna Frances Stacey&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that both bugs and baffles me about some of us Muslims is the carelessness we often show towards the environment, particularly when it comes to disposing of or recycling our rubbish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is so frustrating and confusing to me because I feel that, as Muslims, we ought to be aware that Allah (SWT) has made us His vicegerents here &#8211; trustees of the earth &#8211; which means we are not supposed to cause corruption in any form. This caliphate carries with it great responsibility and it is a test for which we are bound to be held accountable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) mentions in Surat Al-An’am: <em><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>“And it is He who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees [of rank] that He may try you through what He has given you. Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful”</strong> </span><span style="color: #999999;">(Al-An’am:165)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lack of responsibility towards our environment is sadly often all too apparent. My prevailing memory from the time I attended Islam Channel’s ‘Global Peace and Unity’ event at ExCel, London &#8211; a huge venue with several thousand seats &#8211; is the utter mess the attendees left in their wake and the sheer volume of it! There were layers upon layers of promotional flyers and leaflets, drinks cans, fast food remnants &#8211; in and out of their boxes and wrappers &#8211; and all manner of rubbish strewn everywhere and heaped under the seats. I even spotted a used nappy atop a pile of debris. As the non-Muslim cleaners waited in the wings, at nigh on midnight, for us lot to finally go home so they could begin to tidy up, I felt compelled to apologise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As appointed trustees of the earth it ought to be a given that we take responsibility of disposing of (and lessening!) our own rubbish so that our Islamic events do not leave an impression of absolute disarray. And not leaving a nasty mess for others to contend with is surely a basic courtesy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am naturally far from perfect, but I do try to do my ‘bit’, as I consider taking responsibility for my rubbish both as a part of fulfilling the <em>amanah</em> (trust) that Allah (SWT) has entrusted me with and as a test from Him, as well as a form of good <em>da’wah</em> (demonstration of Islam to non-Muslims) and <em>adab</em> (manners).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) reminds us in Surat Yunus: <em><strong><span style="color: #33cccc;">“Then We made you successors in the land after them so that We may observe how you will do.”</span></strong></em> <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Yunus:14)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as I live on a British social housing estate, where there are no recycling facilities, it is not only a test, but a veritable jihad! I can often be seen (and heard) traipsing the mile or so to my local tip with umpteen black sacks full of resounding cans and bottles and plastic stuff tied to each side of my toddler’s buggy looking like one of those ladies who carry their lives around in carrier bags full of rummaged, rubbish-bin treasures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trudging to the tip became increasingly difficult as my last pregnancy advanced. I was around eight and a half months pregnant when the mountain of plastic adorning a corner of my kitchen peaked. One of the mums from my children’s primary school knew of my recycling dilemma and kindly extended an open invitation to her recycling box. So I set out one recycling day at the crack of a very dark and frosty dawn, hauling a modest bundle of carefully washed and rinsed milk cartons. En route to my friend’s house, which was at the top of a rather steep hill, I happened upon a middle-aged gentleman who was putting one or two plastic things in the (virtually empty) box at the front of his house. I felt a sudden sense of camaraderie with this chap, as it seemed to me we shared the same mission in our attempt to save the planet! With this in mind, and the dreaded vertical climb that loomed ahead of a rather rotund and waddling me, I chirped, “Good morning! Would you mind if I popped these into your box, as I don’t have recycling facilities where I live?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man glared at me and hoarsed a very straightforward, “Yes!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slightly confused, I asked cheerily, “Sorry, do you mean, ‘yes, I can’, or ‘yes, you do mind’?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Yes, I do mind”, came the icy reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I continued my marathon hill hobble, annoyed but steadfast in knowing that I am attempting to do my part for the environment by any means necessary. May our efforts to fulfil the <em>amanah</em> of the earth, which Allah (SWT) has entrusted us with, be accepted insha Allah, however small they may be.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Aisha Sadiq shares her fiction piece about Amla, a sister we may not know whom we know.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amla gazed at the crimson sunset for the umpteenth time and said a silent prayer in her mind. ‘This is it, isn’t it?’ she asked herself once more as she drew the curtains across the window panes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She had objectively searched her heart over again and had been convinced like many other times in the past that this indeed was the edifying step she needed (not wanted) to take for a rebirth of her lost self, old… crass… ugly… whatever. Irony is a familiar word with her now and always, for she was certain she was in no hurry to forget it so soon. She heaved a sigh of relief… almost joyful. ‘At last we have gotten here!’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was no hypocrisy really. It was a demeaning life she had been forced to live; masked, lying to herself and others that things were fine, that she was lucky, happy to be where she was or better still where she had been put.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Haydar had married her, she’d had no doubt theirs was going to be a balanced, almost apt union. They both looked forward to a religious, fun-filled and romantic life. And if it had been as they had planned, their affairs would have been such a beauty to behold really. For didn’t Allah say that “Whosoever holds on to the rope of Allah has indeed held onto a grip that’s firm that will never break <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Al-Baqarah:256)</em></span>”?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t always like this anyway. Before she had her first child, Aneesa, things were really fine. Haydar was love and affection personified! He provided for her excellently well; they were all happy and she had nothing to bother her. How many envied her then; to be married to the brilliant, eloquent, good-looking da’i, Haydar was something to covet really. But after Aneesa came Wardah and slowly life began to drain out of their relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Haydar was away for da’wah most of the time. She and the children rarely got to spend quality time with their father anymore. At first, he was understanding and all, making an effort to soothe her worries and make changes to what needed to be adjusted. “After all, you are my family. You come first and deserve my best,” he would say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequently, he began to feel somewhat trapped. Making excuses and promising to make it up to her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the indifferent phase set in. ”Why do you nag me these days, Amla?” he would say, puzzled that she complained. “Don’t you want me to serve Allah?” Amla felt hurt by his sudden non-commitment and how easily he would shrug off her concerns when they meant so much to her. &#8216;Patience Amla, patience&#8217;, she would calm herself. How often she had sat up in bed at night to cry and stare at his empty side of the bed. And in the day, his sitting chair remained vacant. The house maintained a freezing coldness even though the weather was hot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The children’s activities were what kept her warm those many times. She felt so inadequate. The feeling roared inside her, seeking to burst forth.  Apt words to explain her plight simply evaded her. How did she feel? What did she feel? When? How?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But she had managed to keep sane these past years, Alhamdulillah!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All but ‘this’ complaint would have made them such a wonderful family, but ‘this’ is no simpleton. It is a profound ‘singleton’ that has striven to bring all crashing down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amla had persevered to make Haydar see reasons to create a balance. Though he always returned with loads of gifts from his ‘excessive’ trips, she always wondered painfully if he thought his gifts could ever equate his time. There were times she felt the impulse to fling the gifts at him and scream her head off; at such times she would struggle hard to put her bad thoughts in place, mumbling istighfar in her heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the kids, they were often pained by her misery; they would try to cheer her up, but then they were just kids with fleeting memories, weren’t they? And Amla would remain laden with her grief afterwards. She had taken time to think about the fate of the children should there be a divorce, but she should have a life, shouldn’t she? Moreover, the kids were meant to be sources of joy, not barriers to happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of Haydar’s family members and friends were with him in his decision, some were neutral and some many more were in Amla’s support. After a series of counselling together with no progress, she had very few options left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The very first time divorce as an option had struck her mind, she had cringed from the mere thought of it. But as time went on, it appeared to her as the only available alternative to breathe free, to live anew and indeed to get her faith back on track.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many times would she go to his parents to seek advice? About twice she had sought audience with the Assigning Committee to plead for his name to be replaced by another, all to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, she stands on the mountain top of life. She has made up her mind to get separated from Haydar, she has bidden her time and will fly; soaring, breathing free of this life of misery that binds her to this hearth where she once lived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ Sana Gul Waseem shares a true story of the realities of keeping good company.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>“The believers, men and women, are awliya (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another, they enjoin (on the people) al-ma&#8217;ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid (people) from al-munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds and all that Islam has forbidden); they perform as-salah (iqamat as-salah) and give the zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. </strong></span>(At-Tawbah 71)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“How true these words are!” I thought as I looked at the creation of Allah (SWT) bathed in the early morning rays of the sun. Subhan Allah!  I took a deep breath filling my lungs with the pure, blessed morning air before I closed the door behind me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband and I had just returned from the mosque after offering Fajr salah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It has become a routine with us now. We never miss it. These are also the last moments of peace before our five children wake up and the day begins. Each day I thank Allah for this supreme blessing and for blessing me with a friend like Zenia. The journey here would have been very tough without her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zenia and I became friends at the queue for airport security as we were both boarding a flight to San Antonio in USA. Hearts beating fast, brimming with excitement, anxiety, hope and dreams we saw each other and smiled as we recognised the familiar Muslim dress in an ocean of strangers. Quickly, we were drawn towards each other and were amazed to realise that not only were we headed for the same place but also our husbands were from the same university and we had both just got married. The long flight flew by and our first steps towards our new husbands were a little more confident, as we knew somehow we had each other. Time whirled past us as we had kids and then we settled in the regular routine of play dates and picnics and dinner parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then tragedy struck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
My husband lost his job. We were forced to relocate to New Jersey and my husband opened a gas station with his brother in order to support us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The business didn’t make a lot of money at first and they decided to open a pizzeria along with it. As that also didn’t pick up any business initially, my husband and his brother decided to start selling pork pepperoni pizzas and beer to draw in more crowds. And it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each day I fought and lost a battle with my conscience as I used his earnings since I knew that the money was not halal. We were selling what was forbidden! All my pleas and arguments were falling on deaf ears. My husband, pressured by the need of money to feed us here in the States and his parents in our home country, didn’t want to listen to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started despairing and losing hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then one day I got a call from Zenia. My heart filled with happiness at her voice. It had been quite some time since we had last talked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“How are you, Sarah?”she asked me softly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am ok, Zenia,” I replied as tears silently slid down my face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No, you are not,” she insisted. “Tell me what’s wrong,” she demanded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Really Zenia! Why would you say such a thing?” I replied with forced gaiety, wiping away my tears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, because I know you and I can feel the pain in your voice and, most importantly, because I am your friend.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then I told her everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I finished there was a silence on the phone. My heart started beating fast, fearful that she might condemn me and leave me like some of my other friends had when they found out about what we were selling in our shop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I prayed to Allah, “Not her… please Allah… not her too!!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tentatively I asked, “are you there”?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said “Of course. Where else I would be, sweetheart?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A surge of pure relief swept through me and a smile crept across my face for the first time in many days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So, what are you thinking?” I asked her as I wiped my sweaty hands on my dress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am making du’a to Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala and thinking about a solution before I tell you, so keep quiet for a minute,” she replied seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I smiled. She had always been like that. That’s why I had liked her so much. Grounded and rooted deep in the love of Allah and having complete, absolute faith in Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said.” Ok here goes. Do as I say, ok? Pray Tahajjud every night. Don’t miss it and make du’a to Allah. Weep, beg, cry, wet your dupatta and ask Him. He will answer. This is a test, pass it with sabr and don’t fight with your husband. I am sure he also doesn’t really want to do it. Insha Allah, everything will work out.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did as she advised. I had already been praying my Tahajjud salah but the way she said it made me pray it with increased faith and I indeed did cry and weep and wet my dupatta every night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then the miracle happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, as I was passing by a strip mall, I saw a sign on the window of a shop. It was for sale. I told my husband about it that night after dinner, but he didn’t pay any attention to it. I returned to my prayer mat with a renewed vigour. A few days later, as we both passed the same place again, I saw the sign and told my husband again and alhamdulillah he agreed to have a look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the grace of Allah (SWT) he bought the shop. Closed the pizzeria and opened a fix-it-all electronics shop and Allah blessed us with success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shop started doing really good business. I was very content as finally halal income was coming into our house. It brought barakah (blessings)  and peace to our family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alhamdulillah, Allah (SWT) drew us closer to Him as there was a mosque right behind the new shop and, slowly, the call of Allah (SWT) drew my husband towards the mosque and he started going to pray. In fact he became so regular that he started closing his shop upon hearing the adhan and going to pray. Allah (SWT) blessed us more in terms of <em>dunya</em> (world) and drew us closer to Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each day as I thank Allah (SWT) for His numerous blessings, I thank Him from the depth of my heart for a friend like Zenia who encouraged me and made it a little easier for me to pass my test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subhan Allah! May Allah (SWT) give us all the opportunity to be true believers and <em>awliya</em> (close protecting friends) to each other. Ameen.<br />
This is a true story. Names and facts have been changed to protect the identity of the subjects.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[J. Samia Mair finds too much frustration and unIslamic behaviour from Muslim children towards animals.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993300;">Pets are a trust, a fairly big trust from Allah (SWT), that we undertake willingly when we bring them into our homes.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was leaving taraweeh prayers, I found four boys (aged between 9 and 11 years old) throwing a small plastic bottle of water around, like an American football, in front of the masjid entrance. The bottle would smash loudly on the ground, the boys would giggle, and then shake the bottle and throw it again. This was not good timing for these boys. The iman had just “scolded” parents before ‘Isha that the kids were running amuck during taraweeh (I’m paraphrasing here), including wasting water and getting into things they shouldn’t be getting into and that we, as parents, needed to supervise them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thinking that the boys were going to hit some little old lady with a flying bottle when everyone else came out, I discussed my concern with them and told them not to waste or throw the water any more. They seemed fairly unconcerned with the unwanted attention I gave them, but I assumed that they would listen. Not so fast. As soon as I turned around to walk towards my car, the plastic bottle smashed on the parking lot ground, fairly close to me. I turned around, because I was rather surprised that they would so blatantly disregard what an “auntie” had just mentioned to them. As I was discussing again why throwing water bottles is not a good idea, something crawled out of the bottle. It was a frog. It stopped moving. I thought it was dead. I was uncharacteristically speechless. I thought I might throw up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
When the horror and shock was over, I tried speaking calmly with the boys, but I was visibly upset. A young brother in his 20s who had also asked them to stop throwing the bottle mentioned something to me like, “Frogs live in water so it’s not as bad as it could be”. You’ve got to be kidding, I thought to myself. But I responded with something to the effect that frogs might like water, but they are not so inclined to be stuffed in a bottle, shaken up, and thrown 25 yards to smash against the pavement!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
To cut a long story short, I spoke to two of the boys’ babas about what they did and texted the imam, all of whom were rightfully disturbed at what had happened. I then remembered that my daughters told me a few years ago that they heard that some of the boys were killing frogs. Clearly, or at least I hope so, none of these boys was familiar with the fact that the Prophet (SAW) told a physician who wanted to use frogs for medicine not to kill them. <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Dawud)</span></em> One of the Companions, AbdullaahIbn ‘Amr (RA) said that was because their croak is tasbeeh (saying subhan Allah). <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Bayhaqi)</span></em> But it shouldn’t take a hadith for anyone, including a child, to know that treating a frog in this manner is completely wrong in Islam or in any other belief system for that matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Albeit this is not what we see most kids doing to other living creatures, alhamdulillah. And I can recall boys when I was younger doing terrible things to insects and they turned out okay. So, I don’t think it means that these frog-torturing boys are going to grow up to be mass murderers. But it is behaviour that must be stopped for obvious reasons. And the place to instil kindness towards animals begins at home and it is made easy for us because of the Sunnah, which all leads to the topic of this current pet peeve &#8211; pun intended!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
One thing that really disturbs me and which I find difficult to be in the same room with is the way many parents allow their children to treat their pets &#8211; specifically, like toys. Pets are not toys! That felt good; let me write it again &#8211; pets are not toys, and parents are responsible for making sure that their child doesn’t treat them as such.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living creatures that move are not meant to be passed around child-to-child, who are squeezing them too tightly or otherwise causing them discomfort and/or fear. They are not meant to be chased throughout the house when they try to escape; they are not meant to be used as a babysitter to entertain children when a parent wants a well-deserved break. They should not be bought as an impulse purchase to assuage a whining kid. And a pet should never be tucked away in a back room or basement and allowed to be ignored when the novelty wears off. Pets are a trust, a fairly big trust from Allah (SWT), that we undertake willingly when we bring them into our homes.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Seerah and ahadith are filled with stories of our beloved Prophet’s (SAW) kindness towards living creatures and warnings for us to treat them well. Likely most of us have heard the hadith about the man being blessed with Jannah after giving a thirsty dog a drink of water <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Bukhari)</span> </em>or the woman who would enter hell because she prevented a cat from eating. <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Bukhari)</span></em> Most pertinent to the story of the boys above is the one about the bird killed for sport: Whoever kills a small bird for no reason, it will beseech Allah on the Day of Resurrection saying: O Lord, so and so killed me for no reason. And he did not kill me for any beneficial purpose. <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Nasa&#8217;i)</span></em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favourite ahadith which demonstrates our beloved Messenger’s (SAW) mercy to all the world concerns an abused camel: The Messenger of Allah (SAW) entered an orchard belonging to an Ansari and saw there a camel. When it saw him, it began to groan and its eyes shed tears. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) approached it and patted it on the hump and the base of its head until it quieted down. Then he (SAW) asked, &#8220;Who is the owner of this camel? To whom does it belong?&#8221; An Ansari youth stepped forward and said, &#8220;It is mine O Messenger of Allah!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you not fear Allah in respect of this beast which Allah has placed in your possession? This camel is complaining to me that you starve it and put it to toil.&#8221; <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Dawud)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Indeed, one need only look at how the Prophet (SAW) comforted the groaning palm trunk when he (SAW) delivered his first khutbah from the new mimbar to know that all of creation should be treated with kindness. <em><span style="color: #999999;">(Bukhari, Nasa’i)</span></em> This point was particularly brought home to many of us in a recent class. The scholar mentioned that animals will be able to seek justice on the Day of Judgment even though they do not continue on to the next life. He said that this world is the animal’s Jannah and warned, “Woe to those whom make it their Hell.”<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.</span> </strong><em><span style="color: #999999;">(Al-Isra:44)</span></em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[In the second installment of Hafsah Zamir’s story, our heroine Samiah attempts to put her foot down and stamp out the Rishta Hun]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of course, it took a while before Samiah was able to pass the No-Rishta Bill in the house. She hadn’t thought it possible, but after Lubna announced that she’d found her other half, the rishtas became considerably worse and more frequent. Due to the tag-team effort of her mother and sister, there was never a shortage of visits. Despite leaving work as late as possible, Samiah always found someone fished from the murky waters of a seemingly bottomless rishta pool seated in the living room every other evening.  Her mother bribed the patience of these men with a continuous flow of samosas, pakoras and cake, insisting that Samiah would be home “any time soon”. No amount of grumbling and inhospitality towards the suitors on Samiah’s part could prevent her mother’s antics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last straw came when Samiah arrived home one evening after a particularly arduous parents’ evening at school and found an unknown car parked in the driveway. She parked her own car at the end of the road and considered her options. It was not possible to enter the house through the back door and sneak to her room as she had to walk past the living room to climb the stairs. It was too cold and wet to sit in the garden. That would risk catching a cold, calling in sick and being stuck with her mother and the Rishta Hunting Forces checking in every hour. She could stay the night at a friend’s house, but Samiah would then have to call her mother to inform and explain herself and she didn’t have the energy to battle her way through that conversation. And if she just sat in the car and ignored her mother’s continuous calls to her mobile, her mother would most likely call the police and send out a gigantic search party for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah let her head drop onto the steering wheel. She would just have to go in, sneer and bear it. So she drove back to the house, slowly got out of the car, locked it and made her way up the driveway at a snail’s pace. The car parked outside was a red Polo. She was peering through the car’s window when her mother came out of the house and grabbed her arm, pulling her inside “What are you doing dawdling outside? Come inside, poor Faisal has been waiting hours for you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Samiah to discover that Faisal was the brother of a friend of Lubna’s, a friend Samiah didn’t even know existed until now. He was also eight years younger than Samiah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since she had depleted her reserves of sarcastic wit for the day with her students and then her political correctness on their parents in the evening, Samiah sat mute opposite Faisal allowing the boy to prattle on about his maturity and what he knew about treating a woman properly. Her mother nodded away, piling the food onto his plate. Samiah wondered if her mother ever thought about the fact that she might send Samiah’s future husband to an early grave with all the greasy samosas she fed each of these men in order to win them over. Her mother was setting her up to become a newly-wed widow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Samiah’s further disgust, Lubna encouraged Faisal. “Most of the boys at university are such immature mummy’s boys. It’s so refreshing to come across young Muslim men who understand what marriage entails, especially when Islam encourages Muslims to marry young,” she gushed. Faisal beamed at her and then at Samiah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah was not too tired to flash her eyes at her sister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Khadija was fifteen years older than the Prophet Muhammad,” Fasial informed them all, as if he was telling them something they didn’t know already. She stared hard at his scruffy unkempt beard that appeared to be gravitating to one side and the oversized hoodie that his mother hadn’t had time to iron. She hadn’t missed how haphazardly he had parked his Polo in the driveway or the rubbish from a chicken shop takeaway that had been thrown carelessly onto the back seat. She wished she was sitting closer to the coffee table so she could bang her head against it hard enough to knock herself out long enough to wake up and find him gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Instead, she replied calmly “I am not Khadija. And you are definitely not the Prophet.” Fortunately he left a little while after realising he was fighting a losing battle, and after thanking her mother and sister for their hospitality, he left with only a bruised ego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What were you thinking?” Samiah was shaking with passion. She had saved her last energies for this.  “I would have better luck finding a husband from my sixth form history class!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Predictably a shouting match ensued and ended with the Tag Team complaining that Samiah needed to stop being so fussy and give guys a chance, to which Samiah cried out “I would give a guy a chance if you actually thought about who you’re inviting, but clearly a fried-chicken-devouring man-child who can’t iron his own clothes is someone that you think I’ve waited my whole life to marry!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was silence at Samiah’s outburst. Although prone to sarcasm, Samiah did not often raise her voice nor did she become emotional. She blinked back angry tears and promised herself she would not show weakness in the face of her oppressors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If you were just a little more open-minded, baji,” her sister began.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
“No!” Samiah warned her “You have no right to say that to me. You should be grateful that because of my failure Ami and Abu have accepted your little love-marriage when that was off limits to me. You have no idea what it feels like to be on this side of the battle, so do me a favour and stop trying to do me favours.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Lubna burst into tears and ran out of the room. Her mother glared at Samiah: “Now look what you’ve done. Your sister is trying to help you and you are so ungrateful.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah threw her hands in the air in frustration. “I’ve had enough, Ami. You are going to call up Daniyal’s mother right now and set a date for the wedding.” She held her hand up to silence her mother’s protestation. “You are going to marry Lubna off in the next few months and the rishtas are going to stop. If you don’t do this, I am going to move out. I can’t live like this anymore.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She slammed the door on her way out, signalling the finality of her decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No-one believed Samiah would actually move out until she asked Sajid to view a flat that she had seen earlier in the week. Sajid looked at her unsurely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her mother was more shocked now than when Samiah had first threatened, but she had neither stopped making rishta calls nor called Daniyal’s mother. “You can’t move out!” her mother exclaimed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ah, God forbid that an unmarried woman could ever leave her parents’ house without a husband. What a harlot!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her mother didn’t know what harlot meant but she still retorted sternly “I won’t have that kind of language in my house.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m leaving anyway!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah’s father was dragged from his armchair in front of the TV and made to stand in the hallway where they all stood awkwardly having this conversation. “Tell her!” she ordered her husband. “Tell her she can’t leave.” Her father looked at Samiah wearily and shook his head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A girl does not leave her home until she is married,” her mother repeated, irritated by her husband’s lack of response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ve given you my condition Ami, either you set a date for Lubna’s wedding or I leave. The choice is yours.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Tell her that if she leaves I will never speak to her ever again,” her mother insisted, ignoring her. “Tell her, for Allah’s sake!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah’s father looked up at his daughter tiredly and said: “Your mother says that if you leave this house she will never speak to you ever again. And I am telling you that if you leave this house, I will never speak to her ever again.” He returned to his armchair and increased the volume on the TV so he wouldn’t have to witness the aftermath of his declaration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His wife slapped herself repeatedly in the head and wailed dramatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samiah waited patiently until her mother had exhausted herself from her drama and said to her quietly but firmly: “Call Daniyal’s Ami right now”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Fine. Fine! You and your father. Always so stubborn. Always making me miserable!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So she called Daniyal’s mother. By the end of the following week, the hotel for the reception had been booked and Lubna had transformed into a manic bridezilla, wanting to perfect every last detail while constantly complaining about the lack of time to plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Samiah was relieved that the pressure of Lubna’s wedding had removed so much from her own shoulders, the thought of being the unmarried sibling, the spinster auntie who babysat her scores of nephews and nieces, the pitied one, the one who wouldn’t even have cats because she disliked them, began to gnaw at her. Was this to be her legacy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as much as Samiah tried to ignore it, underneath her mother’s irritation with Samiah, there was deep-seated pain that prevented her mother from being entirely happy for Lubna. There was more sadness for giving up on her eldest than the sadness of giving away her youngest. Samiah wondered if witnessing her mother’s pain was worse than being tortured by the Rishta Hunting Forces. For her mother, this wasn’t accepting fate and the higher plans of God; this was accepting defeat and failure.</p>
