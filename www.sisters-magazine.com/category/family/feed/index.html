		<description><![CDATA[Sr. Aneesa from Ilmburst shares how to teach your child Islam, even if you don’t feel qualified.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Aneesa and I’m a mum of four children </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">alhamdulillah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. My husband and I have been quite focused when it comes to our children’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tarbiyyah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because we share the vision that most parents have for their children: we want our children to have a strong Islamic foundation so they are equipped to face the challenges they will inevitably face as they grow up. We want them to have sound principles from the Qur’an and Sunnah which they can use to help them navigate through their daily lives. We wanted to use these tender years to nurture their spiritual development, to get a headstart with their Qur’an memorisation, to spend quality time with them having fun and making positive memories, before they become busy and preoccupied. Our children’s guidance is in the hands of Allah, but we want to be able to say that we tried our best.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Necessity is the mother of invention&#8230;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a home educator, I came across many brilliant educational websites that contained engaging resources, which were comprehensive and everything was available in one place. There was nothing like this for Islamic education. I remember showing my husband one such website, one day, and that’s when the light bulb moment came. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both my husband and I want Muslim parents to feel confident teaching their children Islam, regardless of their background. It’s time to stop outsourcing Islamic education. It’s time to stop outsourcing our children’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tarbiyyah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s our responsibility as parents. And it’s easy! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what we want to show parents through Ilmburst. Ilmburst does the hard work for you. You just print off and use. You don’t have to have a degree in Islamic Studies, you don’t have to come from a particular background, or have a certain education, as a matter of fact, you don’t need much at all. Just a sincere desire to give your child a firm foundation and nurture in their hearts love for Allah (the Most High) and His religion. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A lifetime project is born</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting Ilmburst together was an intense, but incredibly rewarding journey, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">alhamdulillah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband did the bulk of the work, the meetings with the web developers, and the resources that required research and access to Arabic books. For three months, he worked day and night. I worked on creating resources that required a bit more creativity. Before launch, we spent a couple of nights awake, manually uploading 2000 resources onto the server.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a really exciting time. We were both buzzing! The brainstorming parts were mind blowing as we listed the topics that we wanted to cover, and how we wanted to make it engaging and fun for kids, from things like cut out jigsaws, dot to dots, colouring pages, sensory mats, worksheets on different topics, timelines, and play mats for pre-schoolers on different topics. For older children, we wanted resources with more depth and structure, so there are no gaps. We had so many ideas, and one by one, we will work through them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in sha Allah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realised it was a lifetime project. We want to keep adding to the bank of resources </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in sha Allah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, until we have comprehensively covered everything a child needs to know about their religion. It’s all about building that foundation!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A culture of learning</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment we are going through Imam an Nawawi’s 40 Hadith using the packs from Ilmburst. My ten year old takes the responsibility for reading the text in Arabic, my 7 year old reads the translation, and my five year old reads out the keywords with some assistance. My husband then goes through the key lessons from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hadith</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When explaining the lessons, we use examples of things our children can relate to or have experienced before. We then do the activity together or we sometimes do family role plays where the girls can put into practice what they’ve learned. It also shows us how much they’ve absorbed and understood. We then end with a family game of &#8211; wait for it &#8211; Blind Man’s Bluff! The whole ‘lesson’ is so simple, and requires minimal effort, but our children ask for it every week and are disappointed if we have to miss it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the information is there, the translation of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hadith</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is there; the key lessons and principles are all laid out. You can even omit the Arabic, if it’s something you’re not confident with. And everyone is capable of having a bit of fun with their children. Choose a game that you and your family enjoy. Make this whole experience part of your family culture. Your children will remember it with great fondness when they are older, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in sha Allah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it will be something they will want to do with their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Sr. Aneesa’s Words of Advice</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Small but regular</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – You don’t have to do massive projects, keep it simple. Building a foundation requires consistency. The best deeds that are the most beloved to Allah are the ones that are small and regular. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Weave Islam into their lives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – You can’t compartmentalise Islamic Studies as a subject and leave it. Sure, there is ‘theory’ to be learned, but Islam is a religion to be lived. So when things happen in your family life, take a few minutes out to talk to your children, and live the theory. When we experience blessings in our lives, we teach our children the importance of thanking Allah. When we experience hardships, we teach them about patience. When we need to make a big decision as individuals or a family, we teach them to make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">du’a</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Allah and ask for guidance. In this way, not only do we teach them important life lessons and skills but we tie in to their relationship with Allah. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sha Allah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, long after we pass from this world, they will remain strong because of their faith and will then pass this onto their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Learn and grow together</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Study together as a family; what better way is there to bond with your family and come closer to Allah! It may also be a little less overwhelming if you do it together. It’s not necessarily about us being ‘teachers’ and our children being ‘students’. We are all students when it comes to knowledge, and even if your level of Islamic knowledge is quite advanced, who doesn’t benefit from a reminder?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">May Allah (the Most High) bless us all and enable us to nurture our children in the best way possible, make our children the coolness of our eyes and make us leaders amongst the pious.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Little Maysoor is made up of a husband and wife duo who are fervently dedicated to the mission of teaching the beautiful language ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. Who is behind the Little Maysoor brand? What is your story as a family brand?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. We initially started the Little Maysoor in 2014 and we were inspired to undertake such a task due to the importance of learning the Arabic language in our religion. I embraced Islam at the tender age of 19. Three years later, I travelled to Saudi Arabia to study the deen, which included 2 years in an Arabic institute. During this time, I faced so many challenges, mainly because I began learning the Arabic language in early adulthood as opposed to as a child.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. What inspired you to start the brand?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. As parents, we did not want our children to have to face the struggles and difficulties that I personally endured trying to acquire the Arabic language, so we felt it was important that we give our children a head start by incorporating the language into their childhood so that it would be second nature for them when they got older. As time progressed, the desire to share this gift with other people&#8217;s children in the Ummah led us to begin this amazing project to try and teach the Arabic language to children all around the world.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. What was your first product and how did you go about producing it?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. Interestingly enough, our first project/product was an animated cartoon. The animation was about the importance of praying entitled, ‘Have You Prayed?’ The whole idea behind the cartoon was to teach the Arabic language and elements of the grammar in a fun and easy way by by-passing all of the rules which can oftentimes be boring and monotonous. It was at this stage that a family member suggested we make the animated videos into books &#8211; so the focus changed from animated cartoons to books. As we were in the process of writing the book, we then decided to produce plush toys which eventually arrived in the UK in 2015 in time for the Eid celebration.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. What have been your proudest moments in the business?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. We have had numerous proud moments since the inception of Little Maysoor. One of the most memorable moments was when our plush toy products actually arrived in the UK. This was because, in essence, this tangible product that we were holding in our hands initially began as an idea bouncing around in our heads. Then that idea went through numerous rigorous stages up until the final product was finally produced. This is an amazing process and, once the product is finally ready to go to market, you get a huge feeling of achievement and it was definitely a very proud moment.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Another proud moment in our business is when we actually make a sale! It goes to show that all of those doubts we had &#8211; ‘Will the product be successful or will it be a failure?’ &#8211; are alleviated as you now feel validated to some degree. It&#8217;s that feeling of joy, knowing that somebody else who doesn&#8217;t know anything about the journey, the initial concept, the difficulties that you&#8217;ve had to endure, the amount of money that you have had to spend on the product to bring it to market, sees your product and buys into the brand. It&#8217;s a tremendous feeling that has remained consistent from our very first sale in 2015 up until this very day. Every time we make a sale, it brings much joy and it&#8217;s a tremendously proud moment for the whole Little Maysoor team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lastly, another proud moment is when we receive positive feedback from our customers, whether it be a video of their child reading our books or a picture of a child holding and embracing one of our toys or simply a message from a customer explaining how our Arabic speaking toys have helped their child learn a few sentences in Arabic.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. What are your hopes for the future of Little Maysoor?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. Our hopes for the future for Little Maysoor is to be the leading online teaching Arabic resource for children all around the world. We plan to have an extensive range of bilingual books for children of all ages from toddlers all the way up to early teens. We plan to have an array of animated cartoons that will be available on a subscription basis too. We would also like to increase the range of plush toys that we sell including different races, ethnic backgrounds and we would also like to really find innovative ways to connect the children of the Ummah to the Arabic language Insha&#8217;Allah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A new marriage service for reverts could be the answer to the epidemic of marital problems that converts to Islam seem to face.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak to any revert sister for some time and you will no doubt end up asking whether she is married and if so, where her husband comes from. If she is not married, you may find yourself suggesting: “I know a good brother who is looking for a wife”. For some reason it seems that revert sisters are easy prey for a quick marriage match. There are no cultural family details to see to, no need for a large mahr, no real need for a Wali because after all, the brother will be doing her a big favour; marriage is half her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">deen </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after all. Within a short space of time the sister can be happily married!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine four years down the line and you happen to meet that same sister in the masjid with two young toddlers climbing all over her, looking worn down and tearful. She tells you that the practicing brother turned out to be controlling and verbally abusive, always putting her down and comparing her to women of his own culture. As for her in-laws, they never accepted her and her children and the ties of Muslim family kinship she had dreamt of were non-existent. Her own family were bitterly disappointed in her, and the relationship between them and their new son-in-law was always uncomfortable. As things went spiralling downhill, she had nowhere to turn. Having lost her identity, her self confidence and self esteem, she was now stuck in a marriage that she would never have chosen had she been given time to think carefully about Muslim marriage. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly this is not an unusual situation and </span><a href="https://www.solaceuk.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a charity supporting revert sisters in difficulty, finds that a large percentage of their work involves serious marital issues. It is also not unknown for Solace to receive calls from well meaning brothers, offering to support a revert sister by marrying her. They have no idea of the complexities of her situation, whether it be problems she has brought into Islam from a difficult background, or stresses she has experienced after reverting, but  they see marriage as the perfect solution to all her difficulties. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Solace in Marriage” is a new comprehensive marriage service set up by Solace. It will provide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FOUR essential services to revert sisters, and also to those wishing to marry them, in order to protect, support and nurture their futures, inshaAllah.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1) Pre-Marriage</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-marriage courses for revert sisters</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-marriage courses for men wishing to marry a revert sister</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wali Panel consisting of a panel of mature Muslim men and women that act as a ‘surrogate Muslim father’ for revert sisters – vetting the potential husband</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2) Seeking Marriage</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon successful completion of the pre-marriage course, men and reverts can search for a spouse via our carefully designed Solace Matrimonial database</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nikah service with special provision for educating non-Muslim family members and ensuring they are comfortable with the Islamic marriage process</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3) In Marriage</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First year of marriage support packages for revert sisters</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mediation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marriage counselling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Couple retreats</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4) After Marriage                                                                                      </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support for divorced revert sisters</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provisions for single mothers and their children</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remarriage guidance and support</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Solace marriage service will be a new way forward for sisters and brothers to enter, or re-enter, into a marriage which is shaped by guidance and support from the very start. It will embrace the whole family, ensuring that non-Muslim family members are helped to understand and be a part of their daughter’s future. It will aim to strengthen and develop the new family unit, build on the foundations of Islam. And for those sisters for whom re-marriage is not yet written by Allah, it will give them the confidence and strength to rebuild their lives and those of their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASE STUDY 1: Sakina* was a new revert with a soft nature. When she was approached by a sister after the prayers one day, saying her brother needed a wife, Sakina thought it would be good to have a practising brother as her guide and support. However her parents didn’t even know she had reverted yet, as she didn’t yet feel confident to tell them. So when she explained she was going to marry a Muslim, they were shocked and upset, and refused to come to the wedding. Sakina hadn’t yet made any Muslim friends so on her wedding day she was taken to the ladies section of a mosque where some unfamiliar women were gathered. She had no idea what was happening and where her future husband was. After half an hour her sister-in-law announced that she was now married and that they were leaving. Sakina was left feeling confused and upset. Even though her marriage worked out, she still looks back to her wedding with sadness and regret that her family weren’t involved and that it hadn’t been a joyful occasion for her.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASE STUDY 2: Laila* had been looking for a husband for some time but as a single mother of three sons it was proving difficult. She eventually met a brother online who sounded understanding of her situation. Her non Muslim family disapproved and sisters warned her of the dangers of online services. She did go to her local mosque to ask the Imam if he could be her Wali but he apologised and said he was too busy. By this time she was getting to know the brother better and felt it would be fine to go ahead. They met twice and he seemed keen to marry quickly and knew a friend who was an Imam. With two other friends as witnesses, the marriage went ahead. However only three weeks after they wed, he suddenly decided the marriage wasn’t working for him and left her that weekend with nothing but a text message…Talaq, Talaq, Talaq….</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* The case studies in this article are typical of the type of situations sisters who come to Solace for support find themselves in. However, names and circumstances have been altered for confidentiality reasons.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Those early days of marriage with those in-love feelings may seem like a distant dream. SISTERS Marriage Coach, Megan Wyatt, discu]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What kind of marriage did you dream about when you were single? When you finally fell in love and were swept off your feet, you couldn’t wait for that moment to finally be alone with your future husband. How did you imagine it would feel like to sit alone in the car, go out to eat, or sleep next to him at night? The day of the nikkah came, your cheeks sore from smiling, and for the first time you could brush arms, then hold hands, and in the privacy of your hotel room, hug one another. Those first few moments were almost magical, weren’t they?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flash forward to today. Are you still waking up living your dream, or have you found that you both talk less over dinner, chewing in silence while your children fill the quiet with their innocent questions? Does he fall asleep after you, staying up to work on the computer instead of lying with you in bed? Where are the hugs, the text messages, and smiles when you greet each other? A mumbled “salam alaikum” seems to suffice these days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If you have resigned yourself to the belief that once the in-love stage is over, so is true love, happiness and romance, then I invite you to reconsider. There is something more, something rich, deep, and beautiful waiting for you in your marriage. But in order to find it, you will first have to dive into your own self, your own dreams. Who are you today? Whatever you want your relationship to bring to you, be it love, passion, or fulfillment, you’ll soon discover that you first have to bring those very elements into your relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are missing passion, you have to ask yourself “How passionate a person am I?” Have the years eroded your zeal for life, adventure, and your ability to experience life with all five senses? Passion comes from being truly alive, experiencing the gifts Allah (SWT) gives us fully and allowing those gifts to shape us, change us, and mend us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are missing depth in your relationship ask yourself “How deep have I allowed myself to go?” Deep with your own thoughts and feelings when you journal or ponder, and deep with your husband when something he has said or done stirs a warmth in your heart. You cannot swim in deep waters with your toes barely dipped into the shallow edges, can you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are missing love, ask yourself “How have I been loving?” As a woman, our nature is to be loving, but how have you loved your husband as the man he truly is in your life? Have you shown him love in a way that he desires, craves, and yearns for? When you love him like this, you can feel free to express your own loving desires, but it is after you have given first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To bring your marriage back to life, you have to be brave enough to dream again, to desire again, and then go after what you want. Think about the months (years) you spent searching for your husband. How many months were you preparing for the wedding and getting to know your husband? The planning and the “getting to know you” can’t stop. Not then, not now, not ever. What dream could you start planning for today?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c2769c;"><strong><em>How do you forget the past? We&#8217;ve sometimes said or done very hurtful things to each other in the past, but in every argument the past keeps being rehashed? How do we avoid this?</em></strong></span></p>
<p>One of the main reasons people continue to bring up past experiences is because the wound created by that experience has not been healed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we are hurt by someone, we often need a safe space to fully feel whatever emotions were evoked. During conflicts in our relationships, the predominant emotion is usually hurt, beneath all the other knee jerk reactions. We need to acknowledge that the hurt is there and feel it. Our tendency is to protect ourselves, so instead of feeling hurt and crying, which may come to us naturally in such a moment, we set up the “ego protection walls” to hide the hurt, appear stronger than we really are, and then move into attack mode. We start screaming, accusing, blaming, name calling, and firing stabbing words. Our spouses, in turn, hide the hurt, put up their ego protection walls, and another round of unloving and disrespectful words begins. The cycle has begun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the past is dredged up, it arrives at precisely this moment. Either an emotional wound has been touched and the pain reminds you of a previous pain that hasn’t healed yet, or out of fear of there being another painful moment, you remind your spouse of what happened in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s ironic about such a moment is that your intentions deep down are good. Your intention is to protect yourself from hurt and to release your hurt in such a way that your spouse can feel your pain and repair the damage they may have caused. However, when both of you are in defence mode no-one can repair anything, and the cycle persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c2769c;"><strong>What’s the way out?</strong></span></p>
<p>First the ego walls have to go down. It’s scary to show your true feelings at times, but this level of vulnerability is the only door out of that dark and angry room. My husband and I have this rule we live by as much as we can: We never try to deny or minimise what each of us felt during our interactions. For example, if he says “Your comment wasn’t respectful,” then I have to agree, because no matter how I want to see it, or explain myself, the truth is for him it wasn’t respectful. For him to let go and move on, I have to accept what is true for him. If I found an action of his frustrating, he doesn’t try to explain away what I feel. It’s true for me, and it’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is little resistance in a conversation like this. Instead, we find acceptance and the ability to honour each other’s feelings without needing to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to forgive and move on, where the moment literally ends right then and there, you each need to feel heard, honoured, and finally loved. Apologies, and understanding what is at the root of an argument brings you both back together as a team again, as you both look to solve what is the true source of conflict between you. Sometimes, it’s something as simple as being tired and needing more sleep! Other times, it’s that baggage from our past being triggered in us. One of those unresolved childhood issues needs begging for attention. Whatever it may be, when you have truly felt your way through all of your feelings, honoured what you and your spouse feel, and then worked through it together, love will be restored and the past will have no need to come up again in a future conversation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Heba Alshareef gives some insider information to men looking to win the hand of a fabulous Muslimah in marriage.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me tell you about my first crush, Brian. Okay, that sounds bad, I know, but stay with me here. Brian was really cute. He was always very well groomed, his golden brown hair cut and styled to perfection. He was smart and funny. His smile was kind, his ways gentle. And he treated me like a queen. There was the time he hid behind the school fence to surprise me with a bouquet of fresh flowers he’d picked himself. And it wasn’t the flowers that delighted me, but the satisfaction I read on his face which said that he had been successful in pleasing me. There was the time when he insisted on taking me to the school cafeteria and buying me a sandwich. He held my hand and lamented when I said that I couldn’t eat ham which was the only available option (yes, I knew that ham came from pigs and was therefore haram, but I was still a bit ignorant on the boyfriend front). He actually went to the cafeteria supervisor after school and demanded that they serve more options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, Brian. He was smooth. He was my kindergarten sweetheart and I kid you not, I look back on those days and think if only he was Muslim, he would have made the perfect match for a fabulous Muslim sister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what was it about Brian that was so appealing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And how can the single Muslim guy emulate the traits that will win over the heart of his wife to be? Of course, we’re going to assume his faith is solid, as the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) has said in the hadith, “If someone with whose piety and character you are satisfied comes to you, then marry him. If you do not do so, there will be disorder in the earth and a great deal of evil.” <em>(Reported by At-Tirmidhi and others and classified as Hasan).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let there be no question that these two traits are most important, but what else can help his cause?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>1. Humility coupled with confidence</strong></span><br />
Many think that you must be humble, and indeed that is a very good thing &#8211; still, there is a way to also exude confidence. Finding the balance between the two is truly understanding the notion of ‘ihsaan’ –excellence and a sure way to be appealing to females. When said groom proposes, he must be confident that he will win the hand of his intended. He will show he is humble in his mannerisms, but absolutely sure that he can take excellent care of her and has no issues demonstrating this to her and her wali. How can she resist?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>2. Funny is good</strong></span><br />
Having a sense of humour and the ability to make your intended laugh is a trait that will serve you well throughout your long and prosperous marriages, inshaAllah. I had an aunt who, whenever her husband spoke, would stare at him with complete and utter love. The fact of the matter is that he wasn’t the best looking guy on the block &#8211; but everyone wanted to be in his company because he was so funny. May Allah have mercy on my Uncle Mahmood, his ability to make people laugh so hard was only hindered by them having to go to the bathroom constantly while he was speaking. And his wife was his biggest fan! What man wouldn’t want his wife to be his biggest fan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A woman is enamoured instantly when a light hearted chap asks for her hand in marriage because she knows that he’ll be fun. And don’t girls just want to have fun?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>3. Kindness that doesn’t dissuade from decisiveness</strong></span><br />
He buys the mom flowers, he feeds the birds in the park, he helps wash the dishes in the masjid after a potluck Ramadhan iftar. He’s kind, yes. Does this mean that he is weak though? No. Once again it’s about finding that balance between being kind (not code for “doormat”) and still able to make his own decisions. It is how a man is able to take the lead in a way that makes those around him feel safe, yet still surrounded by kindness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As always, the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) himself is the example that best exemplifies how the man should be treating his womenfolk, while still maintaining a sense of focus and determination to do what needs to be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>4. Brains</strong></span><br />
Geeks and nerds shouldn’t be hindered by their labels. Having the ability to speak to his potential mate’s doctor father about the functions of the digestive system and at the same time being able to discuss the latest PSP games with her younger brother will win the Muslim suitor some major points. Women want to be able to respect and cherish the men who they plan to spend their lives with. They don’t want some ignoramus. In the real world, fabulous Muslim women know that intellectual conversation trumps any type of “Prince Charming” fantasy. It’s what keeps things interesting, and gives us something to look forward to when the “Prince Charming” good looks begin to fade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I know that I haven’t mentioned it yet, but looking his best when he approaches his potential mate is certainly not a bad idea. My mom has a picture of my old kindergarten class and Brian really was something else in his three-piece baby blue suit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for those wondering: yes, my husband has approved this piece. He knows that he has surpassed Brian and all the traits that can win over any fabulous Muslimah. Now, brothers desperately seeking to complete half their deen, how about you?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Khalida Haque explores this most tenuous of relationships and offers some tips on how we might make things more harmonious.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we’ve decided to get married. We’ve found the perfect partner. He ticks all the boxes on our spouse checklist and more. But wait a minute &#8230; what’s this? There’s a mother &#8230; and a father &#8230; an older brother &#8230; a younger brother &#8230; half a dozen sisters &#8230; nephews &#8230; nieces &#8230; But what does it mean? Does this mean the end of the marital paradise we had only just been envisaging?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All too often, when we are looking to get married, we focus on the person we are hoping to wed – his character and attributes. We forget that he may come with an entourage, and a large one at that. Or we may insist that we live completely separate from ‘the family’ as we fear them taking over our lives, and in doing so ensure that we remain ‘outlaws’ and outsiders whilst our husbands become human ping pong balls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there are families in which, no matter what we do, we will remain the outlaw. There are mothers who will never see their sons as anything but theirs and we will be cast as the ‘other woman’ from the moment we agree to marry their sons. So what do we do? Hold out for an orphan? Not too many of them around. Below are some ways we might overcome some of the difficulties that might arise during the course of our marriages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Clarify intentions</strong></span><br />
Anything done for the sake of Allah (SWT), fi sabeelillah, cannot be wrong. Marriage and relationships founded on the wish to please Him and Him alone seem to be easier despite the hardships they inevitably encounter. Intentions will need to be continually renewed as there will be times that our egos may take a little hammering, particularly when we feel we have done something well, for the right reasons, or have worked hard but have not been acknowledged. For example, we’ve invited all the in-laws around for dinner, slaved all day in the kitchen and been the most gracious of hostesses, only for the food and/or the house and/or our clothes and/or any number of things to be either criticised or looked down upon. I recall hearing from a Shaykh that when our egos become bruised, we need to examine the extent to which our nafs was involved in what we did. The degree to which we are hurt is the degree to which we acted according to our nafs and in search of praise and appreciation. When we do things with the intention of servitude to Allah (SWT), then the reward is ours whether or not others acknowledge what we have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Think of own family and parents</strong></span><br />
‘Do unto others as we would have done unto us’. Imagine how we would like to see our own family, and, in particular, our parents treated. Yes, as clarified in the May edition of Sisters (Caring for our parents: finding the balance) a son is responsible for the care of his own parents and a wife’s duty is to her own, but what harm would it do to aid our husbands in the care of their parents. Would we not wish the same from our partners and the spouses of our own siblings towards our parents? Showing the level of care towards our in-laws that we show our own parents can serve to increase the love between us, especially when they know that we are not in any way duty-bound or obligated to do so but that we choose to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Step into our mother-in-law’s shoes</strong></span><br />
Or any of our in-laws’ footwear. Just as things are changing for us as a consequence of our marriage, so they change for them. Perhaps not to the same degree for all the in-laws but, even so, an adjustment is necessary to accommodate the addition to the family. Think about a new addition to our own lives, either through marriage or birth: how the person who is now married or has given birth is no longer available in the same way. Likewise, we need to be sensitive to what our in-laws might perceive as a loss. If we can show them that they are in fact gaining rather than losing, we will have achieved a tremendous thing. Also, if we remind ourselves that our husbands’ mothers, our mothers-in-law, can never be repaid by their sons for bearing and rearing them, as no mother can be, we can remain appreciative of what they have done – particularly if our husbands are kind, loving, and well-mannered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Build relationships</strong></span><br />
Get to know each member of your new family individually when and if possible by spending time with them, with and without your husband. As we know, any relationship requires time and effort and what we put in is often what we get out. Make the effort and you will, bi’idhnillah, reap the rewards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Discussion</strong></span><br />
Have a discussion, preferably before marriage, about how you and your spouse will handle different scenarios that might arise, alongside what you expect from each other with regards to your families. If you are clear from the outset what is wanted, then problems are less likely to occur and if they do, you know where you stand. Talking about things as they arise and expressing yourselves facilitates understanding, whilst keeping quiet and bottling things up creates tension. Always consider it as teamwork; you are on the same side wanting what is best for each other and for the family as a whole. If you do, it is more probable that the two of you will to work together as opposed to against each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Patience and gratitude</strong></span><br />
Focus on the positive characteristics. Be grateful for these. Be patient with the difficult stuff. We all need to remind ourselves of how much we have and how much worse off we could always be. Sabr and shukr, as they say, are wonderful things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Be respectful but be just</strong></span><br />
We also need to remember that our in-laws are our husbands’ blood relatives as well as our children’s. Some, especially the parents-in-law, will be our elders and as such, we need to be respectful &#8211; but that does not mean we should put up with anything:<br />
<em><strong><span style="color: #bf0000;">“O you who believe! Stand firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even if it be against yourselves, your parents, and your relatives, or whether it be against the rich or poor &#8230;”</span></strong> (An-Nisa: 135)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #bf0000;">&#8230; Do not oppress and do not be oppressed.”</span> </strong>(Al-Baqarah: 279)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: &#8216;Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or is oppressed.&#8217; A man asked: &#8216;O Messenger of Allah! I (know how to) help him when he is oppressed, but how can I help him when he is an oppressor?&#8217; He (SAW) said: &#8216;You can restrain him from committing oppression. That will be your help to him.&#8217; <em>(Bukhari &amp; Muslim)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if a mother-in-law insists on you doing something that is culturally a tradition but is outside the bounds of Islam, for example, hugging your adult brother-in-law, you can simply state that this is something you are not willing to do and provide an explanation if necessary and asked for. I am aware that things can feel pressured when these sorts of differences arise. However, if you are firm but polite, confident yet compassionate, then, insha Allah, the message will get across.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship with in-laws can be a difficult one or it can be a fruitful one. We need to recognise our part in making it a success and work towards it. If we do, we will become part of the family and the days of being an outlaw will be far behind us, bi’idhnillah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this special post to SISTERS online, Nazir Al-Mujaahid of Outstanding Muslim Parents offers some of his best parenting advice.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How would you answer the question, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people would define themselves through their profession, for example, a doctor or a teacher. Others may define themselves by their cultural background, such as Arab or American. Other still may simply say, “I’m only a mother”. Many times, how people describe themselves is a reflection of how they feel about themselves and in the case of our children, we want them to radiate high self esteem and feel incredible about who they are!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge of crafting an identity and strong personality in our children isn’t as difficult as it sounds if you start early. Think of yourself as a farmer. No, not the kind that toils in a field which is essential to healthy eating, but one that toils something more precious because the soil is more valuable. I want you to till your children’s brains and how they view themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As parents we see how verbal abuse can damage a person’s perception of themselves and how bullying damages a person’s self-esteem. We can engage our children by building them up. Always remember that there are two ways to have the tallest building, one is to build it strong and tall and the other is to tear down all the other buildings around it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I advise you to tell your child how beautiful and intelligent they are over and over keeping in mind that repetition is the mother of learning. It doesn’t matter the stage that your child is in, just try it. In Stage One (1 – 7 years old), Stage Two (8 – 13 years old), or Stage Three (Teenagers), they love to hear compliments and praise, even if they act like they don’t. As a mother or father, is it true that we enjoy hearing compliments? It helps us to feel appreciated and strengthens our iman, insha Allah reminding us to be grateful to Allah (SWT) for that blessing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Stage One</strong></span></p>
<p>Let’s take little Aisha for example. She’s in Stage One at 5 years old. Being young she imitates her mother and plays with her headscarves. She tries them on, prays while wearing them, and she looks so cute! One of the best things you can do when for a young child who is exploring hijab (or anything positive) is to compliment her. Tell her how beautiful she looks and how she is obeying the command of Allah (SWT) by praying, and include other compliments you can give, which when coupled by hugs and/or kisses creates a strong healthy positive neuro-association in their brains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great way to help our children cement their belief is for you to talk to others about them in a positive way where they can hear you. For example sharing with a friend, relative, or spouse you may say how Aisha is so intelligent because she figured out how to complete a math problem or how she’s so creative and artsy because of a drawing she made. This helps breed confidence and before our children know what to think, they borrow our belief in their self until they fully exude it. I call this “planting seeds” which is the most important part of farming because without a seed there is nothing to cultivate and absolutely no harvest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Stage Two</strong></span></p>
<p>Our children’s sphere of influence grows rapidly when they turn school age and are around others who have different experiences. In Stage Two (8 – 13 years old), as they have more exposure and use the internet, they have already formed opinions and perceptions. Now that we are planting seeds we must cultivate those seeds by making sure they are properly fed, watered, and allow the sunshine to reach that soil. Constantly reminding our children of their intelligence, beauty, and at the same time challenging them to stretch themselves by doing more or learning more is part of that cultivation. Allow them enough independence to make mistakes and learn from them while understanding that they are children and not little adults in Stage Two (8 – 13 years old). Letting them dress themselves as they desire, teaching them to make up their beds, clean their rooms, wash the dishes, and understand that doing chores is a part of the first great team they are a part of and it’s called family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must remember that the difficulty with parenting lies with the fact that there is constant conflict with other forces outside of our control, whether it be relatives that don’t share your values, people that don’t share our Islamic beliefs, or the media that makes all kinds of filth look attractive. The sad reality is that by the time a child is 18 years old, they have seen an average of 200,000 acts of violence including 40,000 acts of murder on various media, which can have a profound impact on human psychology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In every stage of our children’s growth, planting and cultivating is a never-ending process and is essential to the way our children grow their personalities. I’m sure you have recognized that your children have their own personalities along with their list of likes and dislikes which may differ from ours. I use a personality test that I feel is one of the best tools I’ve seen when it comes to human psychology and it’s free to use! It’s called the Briggs-Meyer’s Personality Test and I think everyone should take it in order to discover their personality type. When you understand yourself at a deeper level, it will help with all of your relationships especially with your spouse and children. Children 8 years and older can also take the free test at the link at the end of this article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Stage Three</strong></span></p>
<p>In Stage Three (teenage years) is when we begin to reap the harvest of our actions or inactions. During the early teen years as our children’s bodies develop and they go through puberty is when there tends to be a lot of emotional uncertainty due to hormonal changes as they transition through the process. We must be that much more strategic in our praise by reminding them of successes they’ve had and lessons they’ve learned from things they may have failed at. In the Coach role, we build them up and continue to support them on their road to independence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing we must do as Muslims is to infuse the lessons we have learned from the Seerah of the Prophet (SAW) and from the Qur’an. If we only focused on our children’s psychology without infusing our Islamic beliefs then we are doing our children a disservice. Reminding our children of the jealousy of siblings we can share the story of Prophet Yusuf (RA) or when dealing with children’s stormy relationships with their fathers we can share with them the story of Prophet Nuh (RA) or Prophet Ibrahim (RA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reminding our children of how the Prophet (SAW) was slandered and boycotted, and how even his near relatives despised him during his da’wah can help our children hold Islam as relevant today as opposed to simply historic events. Teaching our children of how his patience was rewarded is also essential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must also balance the amount of times our children hear the words “no” and “don’t” with the amount of yes’s they hear. It’s estimated that children hear 148,000 no’s and don’ts before they are grown, and most of those happen when they are very young. If we simply celebrate them when they are doing something right or we tell them “yes” to counteract the feeling that so many things “can’t be done” then we take a huge step in creating balance and helping our children’s growth instead of stunting it. This also helps them to not feel that Islam is all about haram instead of halal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a farmer and focusing on your crop by implementing these techniques over time can help you raise psychologically sound children with a strong sense of identity who are at ease in their personality. So that when your child is asked, “Who are you?” they can confidently respond that they are a Muslim who is intelligent, beautiful, happy, proud, or fill in the blank with any positive traits that fits their personality.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[If you always turn to someone besides your spouse first with your problems and woes, seeking their advice, help or opinion, your m]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been several years since I got married, and even more since I have been witnessing the difficulties in the marriages of a few Muslim friends: sisters who seek my personal counsel now and then. In retrospect, if there is one thing I have learned, it is the wisdom behind Allah’s description of one of the prime qualities of righteous Muslim wives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">“Therefore, the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to the husband), and guard in (the husband’s) absence what Allah would have them guard…”</span> </strong>[Quran &#8211; 4:34]  </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I studied the Qur’an at first, as a young teenager, I did not understand why the angels Hārut and Mārut were sent with the ability to teach witchcraft (called “sihr” in Arabic), as a fitnah for mankind, with this “magic” described further in the Qur’an as “that which creates discord between a man and his wife.” <em>[Quran &#8211; 2:102]  </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years of experience have taught me the great Divine wisdom behind Allah’s laws, commands and words. I have also significantly understood why people want to cause dissension between a husband and wife. It happens more subtly and rampantly than we naively believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let us accept the fact that the reason why the husband-wife relationship is the prime target of Satan, our avowed enemy, is that it forms the foundation of the happy, hearty, productive Muslim family unit. This unit is, in turn, the foundation of a righteous society. If this relationship is good, the Muslim home functions smoothly, and the next generation of Muslims grows up morally and spiritually upright. However, if the husband-wife relationship is rocky and tumultuous, it undermines the emotional well-being of every individual in the family, particularly the children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing helps raise better children than righteous Muslim parents who are emotionally close, compatible like good friends, and incessantly loving towards each other. If the parents are practicing Muslims as individuals, but do not get along well with each other, the children will not be able to grow up feeling emotionally secure and confident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early days, a husband or wife – or both – usually continue to seek advice and guidance in their personal matters from their parents, out of  habit:  both are young, inexperienced in making independent decisions, and not very close to each other. However, parents on both sides should discourage this in the long term as it can undermine the pair’s close relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine the wife always turning to her mother, father, sibling or friend when she faces any problem, be it a pregnancy-related ailment, a plumbing fault in the kitchen, or – Allah save us – intimate details of her last fight with her husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the husband might consult only his father for financial and career advice, or his siblings or friends when worried about some workplace problem, giving his wife attention only when retiring to bed at night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If both spouses continue thus, it will not be long before things take a downturn between them. This is because, no matter how close someone else might have been to the husband or wife before marriage, continuing to confide in them instead of their spouse will make them find out intimate marital details, which in turn will make them involved. Interference and conflict will be the obvious outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents of the couple like to feel needed even after the marriage and take their time to let go. It is, however, entirely up to the wise couple to keep their personal matters to themselves; even something as trivial as what they had for dinner, what ornament they just bought for their living room, or what they plan to do with the annual job bonus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early in the marriage, say within one or two years, if things are not rectified, a wedge will form between the couple, and it can continue to keep them emotionally apart from each other with each passing year, even if they continue to occupy the same bed and have children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In joint family systems, it is the wife who usually compromises, because she has little personal privacy or independence, and has to always “share” her husband with his relatives. More often than not, he continues to be close only to his family, treating his wife as just a housekeeper and child-bearer. He comes home and unburdens himself on his parents and siblings, whilst his wife is busy with the household chores. A wife might feel like talking to her husband after his day at work, but as soon as she sits with him, his mother may ask her to make the tea. When she leaves, her husband will then talk to his mother. This can make his wife seethe with frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Many women piously put up with this compromise on their basic marital rights without protest, year after year. However, this acquiescence undermines their long-term marital happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said before, it is entirely up to the individual husband and wife themselves to keep their guard up about divulging their personal matters to their families, whilst maintaining their mutual closeness. Polite but firm tight-lipped-ness should meet questions like, “So, are you in the family way yet?”, “Did you find out at the last ultrasound if it’s a boy or a girl?” or “What salary are you getting since your promotion?” We must remember that our parents and relatives love us and are concerned about us, however, whether their concern transforms into meddling is totally up to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, individual families are always much more complex, and marital problems cannot be painted with a wide, generalising brush. Some couples are very open and accommodating with their respective families, with everyone living together very cordially, sharing everything in life without any problems. Each case is different, and what might work for some, could cause problems for others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best advice I can give to a married person is this: whenever you have to unburden yourself about a problem, or seek counsel before a major decision, or just need to vent your emotions:</p>
<p>1.  Turn to your spouse first &#8211; yes, even before you talk to your parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.  Consult your spouse, even if you have mentally decided what to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.  Conceal your spouse’s faults behind their back, and if someone mentions these fault(s) without just cause before you, be quick to come to their defence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, spending time together, openly communicating, and being emotionally available and responsive to your spouse is of prime importance for the marital relationship. Other relationships can be given their dues without compromising the closeness between husband and wife. This needs discretion, wisdom and tact, not to mention fear of Allah and conscious obedience of His commands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>Sadaf Farooqi is a Pakistan-based mother-of-two who has faced and overcome with Allah’s help, a wide spectrum of marital challenges. One of the most important lessons she learnt is that a person should not compromise emotional closeness to a pious spouse for the pleasure of others.</em></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Papatia Feauxzar shares her experience of growing up in a multi-faith family.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Perhaps Allah will put, between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them, affection. And Allah is competent, and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.” Qur’an 60:7</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we all coexist? Well, in my family’s experience with mixed religions, we sure do. My late father, may Allah (SWT) grant him <i>jannah al firdaws, </i>was a university teacher and a Muslim scholar. He married three women; one of which was a non-Muslim whom he later divorced for non-religious matters. And all her children became non-Muslims after his death. My father foresaw their conversion to Christianity and he said that as long as they believed in God after his death, he was okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, my father was very tolerant. He was also respectful and gave the benefit of the doubt to anybody. As a matter of fact, he had heard rumors that his first wife sneakily went to church even though she had converted to Islam sometime during their marriage. My father didn’t believe it even if he had his suspicions. He told the gossipers that until she told him or he caught her, he wouldn’t say or do anything. See, my father could have responded to fitna-seekers with something like, ”I’ll not tolerate a <i>kafir</i> woman in my house!” and such but he kept his cool and went on with his <i>deen.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when Ben, the last child from my father’s first marriage, heard that my mother &#8211; the second wife &#8211; was pregnant with me, he couldn’t wait to get a little sister. My strong connection with Ben had started while I was still in the womb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I’m the cutoff line. Before me, they are all Christian. From me to all the children after me, it’s a branch of the Muslim <i>ummah</i>. We just respect each other’s religious choices and pray for each other. We have such a good spirit about having different religions because in Surah 60 verse 8, Allah (SWT) says:</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #d68bb1;">“Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes &#8211; from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.”</span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here we see that Allah (SWT) allows believers of different religions to be friends as long as they’re just and fair. In addition, why would our beloved Prophet (SAW) send his <i>ummah</i> to another country ruled by a just Christian ruler? Because we can coexist!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My brother Ben and I are still very close. We call each other often and we chat when we can. We have a connection that no one in the family has. We love each other deeply even though we are from different religions, and we know our boundaries. We coexist and make it work even though some distant family members are not on board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If <i>La Convivencia </i>(The Coexistence in Spain) happened centuries ago where Muslims, Jews, and Christians lived in harmony despite some sources that state otherwise, it’s very possible to coexist. We have to want it. We have to be willing to put our differences aside and not try to shove our beliefs down other people’s throat. In my family, we don’t preach to each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As former Muslims, my older siblings know the third Islamic pillar of faith is the <a href="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/2015/09/28/heavenly-books/" target="_blank">belief in all the books of Allah</a> (SWT) which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Suhuf: the Sacred Scripture which was revealed to Prophet Abraham (RA)</li>
<li>The Torah: the Sacred Book which was revealed to Prophet Moses (RA)</li>
<li>The Zaboor (Psalms): the Sacred Book which was revealed to Prophet David (RA)</li>
<li>The Injeel (Gospel): the Sacred Book which was revealed to Prophet Jesus (RA)</li>
<li>The Noble Qur’an: One must believe that the Qur’an is the Speech of Allah (SWT) which Angel Gabriel brought to Muhammad (SAW) and that it is the last of the Divine Books which abrogated all previous Books.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>From &#8211; (<a href="http://www.thekeytoislam.com/en/what-are-the-pillars-of-faith.aspx">http://www.thekeytoislam.com/en/what-are-the-pillars-of-faith.aspx</a><a href="http://ummuabdulazeez.com/islam-101/the-6-pillars-of-faith/">http://ummuabdulazeez.com/islam-101/the-6-pillars-of-faith/</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just by looking at the reverence in Islam of other faiths, we should know that we are supposed to coexist with respect. Now, if someone believes in something other than those faiths cited above, we should just act fair toward them. We don’t judge them and we don’t pester them with our beliefs. No one likes to be hammered with preaching. It actually turns people away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Surah 60 verse 1, Allah (SWT) says:</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #d68bb1;">“O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth, having driven out the Prophet and yourselves [only] because you believe in Allah, your Lord. If you have come out for jihad in My cause and seeking means to My approval, [take them not as friends]. You confide to them affection, but I am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared. And whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.”</span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These verses above tell us that if we know that someone of a different belief than us has declared themselves an enemy to us, we must stay clear of that person. But only then, under those circumstances. So otherwise, what do we do? Coexist!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, only Allah (SWT) is and will be the Judge of our actions in this worldly life because in Surah 45 verse 17, He says:</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #d68bb1;">“And We gave them clear proofs of the matter [of religion]. And they did not differ except after knowledge had come to them &#8211; out of jealous animosity between themselves. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.”</span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being in good terms with people of different beliefs is a favor of our Rabb. Which of His favors are we going to continue to deny, <i>ummah</i>? Above all, in order to coexist, tolerance and respect have to be taught at home— the first school. And we can all cohabit peacefully if we have this foundation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[What’s your relationship with your siblings like? Despite all the fights, Zuleikha Sayani loves her brother to bits - he lights ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;She turns her face to look at him, her big brother, her ally in all things, but his face is too close and she can’t see the whole of it. Only the dip of his brow, the rise of his nose, the curve of his eyelashes. But she doesn&#8217;t mind. She is happy enough to be near him, with him &#8211; her brother &#8211; and as a nap slowly steals her away, she feels herself engulfed in a wave of absolute calm. She shuts her eyes. Drifts off, untroubled, everything clear, and radiant, and all at once.”</em> &#8211; Khalid Hosseini, And The Mountains Echoed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He sleeps on my bed, he’s annoying, he’s irritating, he’s full of himself and he can drive me absolutely insane. I am not an abusive person, but he brings out the worst in me. He can make my hands hit and my mouth speak insults I didn’t even know I knew. He can make me cry, scream, shout, laugh, smile but most of all, he can make me happy in so many different ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My brother is your average brother &#8211; silly, childish and mean &#8211; but what makes him different is his ability to make his sister feel like the luckiest person alive. Although we fight, take one another’s belongings and embarrass each other in public, we manage to maintain a strong and loving relationship. Yes, we hate each other at times and we can hurt each other too but at the end of the day isn’t that what siblings are for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All siblings fight at some point or another. It’s bound to happen as we spend so much time with each other. Fighting doesn’t mean we don’t love each other; in fact it can even increase our love. Sometimes it’s jealousy, anger or even betrayal that gets in the way of this wonderful relationship but, at the end of the day, we have to keep our ties of kinship and this makes sense &#8211; I have no idea what I would do without my brother. “… and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship)…” <em>(An-Nisa:1)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, I turn to my brother when I’m not feeling too good. Perhaps I’m at school and I’ve had a pretty bad day. Maybe I got a detention, my teacher told me off or I had a fight with my friends; maybe I’m just feeling down. Who’s the first person I text? Who’s the person I tell to get me loads of ice cream, lots of tissues and pour my heart out to? For me, it’s my brother. So many people talk about how a sister is a companion to a sister, but my brother has done the job of a sister a hundred times better. I actually ask him for advice on fashion: should I wear this dress or that one? Will a pink scarf suit this or a white one? He often asks me for advice too &#8211; it&#8217;s usually on what tie matches his suit. Despite the fighting, we rely on each other and he easily qualifies as my most trusted companion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout our sibling rifts and our most adoring relationship, the fact remains: my brother is my best friend (even when he’s blue tacked the pages of my reading book together!). We’ve done some pretty harsh stuff to each other and sometimes we’ve fought and almost destroyed our relationship, but each time we do fight we get closer and come back stronger. He has been there for me through everything, in all that I’ve been through. He’s the one person I can always rely on regardless of what he says or does to me. I love him to bits and he loves me too and, for me, that is the most beautiful thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see myself in the future battling the battles life sends me, hurling stones at the pain it delivers to me, but I can also see myself lying on the floor, defeated with nothing and no-one. In that time, in that moment, in that thought I can see my brother coming to save me. I don’t need a superhero like Superman or Spiderman because, if I have my brother, I have all that I will ever need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we get so engrossed in all the big problems, we forget the small solutions. My brother’s presence can instantly make my heart glow, my smile come and my laugh fill the room. His presence can make me joyful inside and feel like everything I need is at my fingertips. His presence can make me feel special and loved. Isn’t that what family is about at the end of the day? Isn’t that the aim of having a brother, ‘an ally in all things’?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a brother can be a blessing at times and sometimes a nuisance, but that is basically the essence of our relationship and, in fact, of any siblings&#8217; relationship. So, dear brother, I know you’ll be the first person to read this so let me just say that I love you and that you will always be the shining star in my life, be it beautiful or dull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Heba Alshareef discusses how to deal with the bumps on the road of marriage. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a friend of mine recently passed the 7 year mark on her marriage, I said to her, “Now you can relax, you’ve passed the proverbial ‘itch’ period and it should be smooth sailing herewith.” I’m referring, of course, to the bit of conventional wisdom that says that the first year is the hardest; conflicts lessen after the fifth year and, by year seven, be wary of boredom or “itch” because it can trigger thoughts of divorce. Conventional wisdom should sometimes be taken with a grain of salt, but personal experience and years of researching the topic tell me that these flags aren’t far off the mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can hold firm until this critical time is over, then, insha Allah, you will have gathered a wealth of knowledge about what works and what doesn’t work for you and your husband. You’ll come out a winner. Or at least a survivor. And although I say that tongue-in-cheek, in today’s age of prolific marital discord, it might be the best some hope for. But, with practise, and following some key points (and turning them into sustainable habits), we can hope for more.  We can hope for wedded bliss and a newlywed phase that progresses and matures happily, in spite of any bumps in the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><em><strong>Here are a few guidelines for dealing with said bumps.  </strong></em></span></p>
<p><em>A caveat here:</em>  as the article title suggests, this is meant to help with the differences that are NOT the “we need an arbitrator” type ones.  For those, you may need to see a counsellor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>1. Perspective Please</strong></span><br />
Most Muslims don’t really “know” their marriage partner at the beginning of their union, but even if you’re married to “someone you’ve known since you were a child”, you need to realise that everyone is an accumulation of experiences that are perceived in very different ways.  You don’t know what really happened in his life, the events that shaped who he is and how he perceives the world. Why does he get so angry about things that you find funny? Why doesn’t he bat an eyelid over things that infuriate you? He perceives your nonchalant attitude as annoying; you think he doesn’t care about your feelings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Communication is key to discovering these nuances, the differences between the two players in one marriage, but often times (especially in the heat of an argument) the rules of civil conversation are brushed aside while he and she let their egos get the better of them.  And so, for harmony’s sake, it’s imperative for one or both to step back, to look at the situation objectively, to try and see the argument from the perspective of the other party.  Only when this comes into play is there a chance for a happy resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s about the proverbial “walking in another person’s shoes” and trying to see where they’re coming from. And when you can see that, you can begin to understand what’s really going on and calm should ensue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>2. Stop Over-thinking, Start Over-Laughing </strong></span><br />
Aisha (RA) said, “I raced with the Prophet (SAW) and beat him in the race. Later, when I had put on some weight, we raced again and he won. Then he said, ‘This cancels that’, referring to the previous occasion” <em>(Ahmad)</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Couples take things too seriously. They worry about finances, and the best way to raise their children, and what the in-laws will think about this or that, and&#8230; finances.  Without doubt, these things are important and have a place when it comes to strategising about their plans for their lives and for their future – but so many marriage partners don’t know where to draw the line.  They fret so much about these responsibilities – that they miss out on the chance to have fun.  They miss out on the pleasurable moments that can build lasting memories and even sustain them when times get rough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make it a habit to share jokes or get him to push you on the swings or try a light-hearted moment when you might otherwise be huffing and puffing over something.  I recently got this one in my inbox (don’t ask from whom):</p>
<p><em>A young couple were on their honeymoon. The husband was sitting in the bathroom on the edge of the bathtub saying to himself, “Now how can I tell my wife that I’ve got really smelly feet and that my socks absolutely stink?” </em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, the wife was sitting in the bed saying to herself, “Now how do I tell my husband that I have a problem with really bad breath?”  </em></p>
<p><em>The husband finally plucks up enough courage to tell his wife and so he walks over to the bed, gets close to his wife and says, “Darling, I’ve a confession to make.”  </em></p>
<p><em>And she says, “So have I, love.”  </em></p>
<p><em>To which he replies, “Don’t tell me, you’ve eaten my socks.” </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Study after study suggests that the couple who laughs together stays together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>3. Steering the course </strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff9900;"> <em><strong>“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend </strong></em></span><em><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>(to support them) from their means&#8230;” </strong></span>(An-Nisaa:34).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who are familiar with my work or who have worked with me might attest to the fact that I am a champion of strength for Muslim women.  Strength of purpose, strength of vision, strength of self-image.  But when it comes to marriage and husband and wife interaction, I actually encourage women to take a step back and let their men take the lead. The thing is that the one doesn’t have to be removed from the other. As women generally, and as wives specifically, we can be both strong and supportive and in need of being taken care of. And when you find the ability to balance your strengths and weaknesses, you will find the ability to master your marriage, to let go and let your husband steer the ship of your marital life when things get rough.  It’s his responsibility and duty to make final decisions about the things you might argue about. It is he who will be questioned about how he guided his flock &#8211; so take a step back and give him the space and support to do just that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muslim women should live by this hadith: The Prophet (SAW) said, “A woman who offers her fardh salah, fasts the month of Ramadhan, protects her chastity, and obeys her husband, will enter jannah from whichever door she chooses” <em>(Ahmed).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah (SWT) knows the nature of women. He, azza wa jal, is our creator. He knows what we need. And when we have husbands, good, Allah-fearing husbands, then He (SWT) has given us the formula that will make us happy in this life and the next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>4. A little gratitude goes a long way</strong></span><br />
Narrated Ibn ‘Abbas: The Prophet (SAW) said: “I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful.” It was asked, “Do they disbelieve in Allah?” (are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied, “They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favours and good done to them. If you have always been good to one of them and then she sees something in you (she dislikes), she will say, ‘I have never received any good from you.” <em>(Bukhari)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a friend called me one night, distraught over a blow up she’d had with her husband, and wanting advice, I asked how it happened.  She said she’d been trying to please him with a delicious dinner, but afterwards he turned on her when she suggested he wash the dishes. “He turned it into a disaster, bringing up my shortcomings in everything,” she said.  I’ll spare you the details of what he said.  But in between her tirade, something more important came up. It turned out that he’d brought home a gift for her – one that she didn’t particularly like. She had asked if he’d kept the receipt for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, that’s it then,” I told her. “You have to treat his gifts like they’re wonderful – if only because he’s wonderful. He’d probably been looking for it all day, wanting it to be perfect, wanting you to love it.  He might not even realise why he’s angry but it’s probably because your displeasure was a rejection.  Men are like that.” Yes, I said it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate his gifts; count all your blessings constantly.  Believe me, you’ll be happier for it.  Know gratitude for ingratitude leads to misery – in this life and the next.  And keeping the peace is a sure fire way to mark your seven years and beyond.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this two-part series, Timea Csányi meets sisters who are in polygynous marriages. Here, she meets two Muslimahs who are very h]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polygamy, or rather polygyny, is among the most controversial, yet often misunderstood, issues when it comes to Islam &#8211; among non-Muslims and Muslims alike. Undoubtedly, polygyny doesn’t suit everyone; it needs lots of patience and compromise. But as Allah (SWT) gives this right to men, there must be wisdom behind it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand polygyny, there are two important points we need to consider. First, Allah (SWT) in the Qur’an allows the option of marrying more than one wife, up to four, with certain prerequisites that must be fulfilled: justice with time and financial support. This is a huge responsibility on men, which is often neglected when Muslim men tend to look at polygyny through the lens of their heated desires, thereby breaking their family’s heart. They forget that the main purpose of polygyny is providing support and care. While most sisters in normal circumstances would never want to share their husband with anyone, the reality is that many sisters find themselves in the situation where the option of polygyny enables them and their kids to live in a family and feel loved and cared for. Thus, polygyny should unite and not tear families apart, nor cause hatred. It should not be forced on anyone, but approached wisely with the right intention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although, we hear more stories of heartbreak than the positive stories in relation to polygyny, there are still wonderful examples where instead of jealousy, everyone is content and wives feel sisterly love towards each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For sceptics out there, the following story of Sister Mariam* and Fatimah* is an outstanding example of polygyny. They both live in the West in different countries, yet are dreaming to finally move in together &#8211; all under one roof. Mariam is the first wife and married her husband, with whom she raises their children, a decade ago. So then, you might think, one day her husband decided to marry another woman. Well, the reality might surprise you; the notion of having another wife originated not from the husband, but from sister Mariam herself!</p>
<p>“I just felt like this was something he was meant to do very early on, but it wasn&#8217;t something where I looked around. Then, I got to know Fatimah, and I just had a feeling, which Allah put in my heart I believe, that this was meant to be.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mariam has always looked at polygyny in a positive way as something which intrigued her, but prefers more of a “sister-wife” approach, just like among Mormons. She believes polygyny can work well if all wives are informed and consent. “This approach acknowledges the relationship between co-wives as a special bond, and they are expected to have good-will and sisterly love for one another. Sister-wives often live together or at least live as neighbours while being co-mothers. Hence, this female-female support can free up a lot of mental space and time for women as well. What I also like about this approach is that adding another wife and her kids is a family decision, and the compatibility of the wives is included alongside her compatibility with the husband. That’s important, because, I believe, that for most women, problems like jealousy come because of how Muslims approach poly in the first place. Usually, the husband finds another woman who is a stranger to the first wife, thus women perceive each other as threats. In my case, I’ve found that my husband and I had a sort of &#8220;renewal&#8221; of our marriage when he married Fatimah, because he was able to appreciate all the things about me he loves.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before agreeing to the marriage with Mariam’s husband, Fatimah had just left an “emotionally turbulent” marriage, as she describes it, with mixed feelings about polygyny in general, though she had already started to incline to it. She knew Mariam’s husband professionally before, and with Mariam they had had a lot of mutual acquaintances, but only really ‘clicked’ when they actually got to know each other and became best friends. Thus, when Mariam came up with the idea, she contently accepted it, which she hasn’t regretted since then. “I’ve never felt jealous for Mariam; we care for each other deeply, and despite the fair amount of challenges, we try our hardest to nurture our relationship as both part of and separate from poly/our husband,” Fatimah adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de094c;"><strong>What are the challenges?</strong></span><br />
Fatimah: “For me, the greatest challenges have been my emotional baggage from my previous marriage and facing up to my insecurities. I was afraid whether I would be able to develop a healthy emotional relationship with my husband in light of my baggage, and how long distance would contribute to that. I was also nervous that perhaps I wasn’t as interesting in ‘real life’ as I am online!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mariam: “Usually family disapproval, social disdain and internal struggles a person naturally faces when they feel insecure or jealous. It’s also been hard to watch our kids missing their dad for days in a row while my husband has been gone. ”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de094c;"><strong>Reactions</strong></span><br />
Co-wives can face another troubling challenge when entering into a polygynous marriage: making their wider family accept their decision. While most of sister Mariam&#8217;s family is yet to know, she predicts it won&#8217;t be much of an issue because her family is very &#8220;hands-off&#8221; when it comes to her personal decisions. However, Fatimah’s Muslim parents were directly against her decision to become a second wife, but soon realised that they had no legitimate shari’ah reason to forbid her from it. “My relationship with my parents is better now, but still very tense.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mariam had this to say about her kids’ reactions, “They love their stepmom. They’re not bullied, because I homeschool them, and among our Muslim friends, polygamy is recognised as normal.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fatimah has a young daughter from her previous marriage whom her biological father doesn’t want to have any contact with, thus Fatimah’s husband is now her father figure. At the same time, she also loves Mariam, or “Aunty”, as she refers to her.<br />
In such an unusual situation where the first wife initiates the idea of having a second wife, no doubt, the most fascinating question arises, what was the husband’s reaction? Which man doesn’t dream of having two women for himself, one might think, but polygynous marriage is not all about fun. Rather, it’s a huge responsibility not only financially &#8211; especially living in the West &#8211; but physically and emotionally, too, keeping in mind that if one doesn’t maintain that God-expected justice, he risks his place in Jannah. Unfortunately, this essential part is often forgotten by many brothers. But masha Allah Mohamed*, Mariam and Fatimah’s husband, is a role model in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Mariam: “First, he was very surprised at the idea. It&#8217;s been very stressful for him because he worries a lot that he isn&#8217;t doing a good job (he is). He loves us both very much, and we all have great chemistry together, but the stress of finances, being equal (which he takes very seriously), and having to leave one family to visit another has been very draining for him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de094c;"><strong>Polygyny vs. Monogamy</strong></span><br />
“Polygyny still consists of two monogamous couples and each marriage exists on its own no matter the number of wives. I think brothers should generally be monogamous, and if anyone wants to go into poly, they should make sure they’re really great at monogamy first. I do think monogamy is the ideal for most women, and I realise I&#8217;m an exception to the norm,” Mariam says.<br />
“The second wife definitely has to be aware of the risks she’s taking and potential issues that could arise legally speaking. Therefore, I do strongly recommend that for those who feel a strong need for legal status as wives, they discuss this with their potential husbands and co-wives. Depending on the country you live in, there may be ways to cohabit without formal documentation and to negotiate or determine parental rights in the eyes of the law. In my case, unfortunately our marriage is not legally documented yet, but there aren’t any problems with it as Mohamed is an honourable man who does his best to support me.” Fatimah adds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #de094c;"><strong>Advice</strong></span><br />
Fatimah: “Never go into a polygynous marriage without the first wife’s knowledge and (relative) peace of mind. You need to have a genuine, ideally good, friendship with each other outside your marriage, so that you feel about her the way you feel about your other good friends. At the very least, remember the hadith about wanting for your sister in Islam what you want for yourself. This is almost as important as your relationship with your husband. Also, do your research. Don’t go into it lightly. Think hard about the consequences for you and your children.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mariam: “Build your relationship with Allah through the hard times, and hold your husband accountable if he is mistreating you. If your husband wants to do it, be part of the decision and meet your co-wife and make her someone you both agree to.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Maria Zain takes a look at finding your better half, and fulfilling half of your faith.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pick up any book about a devoted Muslim’s way of life and you will find passages and even chapters devoted to married life. As marriage represents half of our faith, it makes perfect sense to make that half the best half. This, in essence, is to choose the best spouse as one’s soul mate all the way to Jannah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Piety – top of the list.</strong></span><br />
With Prophet Muhammad (SAW) as the best of advisors, a resounding narration reminds us that “a woman should be married for four reasons: for her property, her status, her beauty and for her religion; so marry one who is religious, so you may be blessed.” <em>(Bukhari)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Piety plays an important role in a marriage through life partners who encourage each other to love all that is halal for the sake of Allah (SWT) and hate all that is forbidden for the sake of Allah (SWT) too. So even if a man is attracted to a woman’s beauty, wealth or upbringing, her piety should take precedence over the other things. The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) told us that ‘The whole world is a provision, and the best provision of the world is the pious woman,” (Muslim) as choosing our spouses shapes the household and the generation of Muslims to come. And while these ahadith seem to be aimed at men, the same holds true for women. We all have a good idea of the traits we want in a husband and although wealth, status and charming good looks are amiable ingredients in a man, Islam advises choosing a husband who can be a good leader of the household.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Prophet Muhammad’s (SAW) farewell sermon, we are reminded of what we can expect of a husband who remains God-fearing and conscious of the presence of Allah (SWT) at all times: he will be fair and just to his wife, respect and honour her rights, in return for obligations that his wife has towards him. Prophet Muhammad (SAW) himself was a living reminder, the best husband of all time, due to his piety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Take a good look at ourselves</strong></span><br />
<em><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>“And women of purity are for men with purity. And men of purity are for women with purity,”</strong> </span>(an-Nur: 26). </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same way Allah (SWT) wishes for men to find pious wives, we too must seek out men with piety, who provide for, honour, and respect us, who will be doting fathers to our children, and will lead the family with the best values Islam has to offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the verse above, it is also an important reminder that the spouse of choice is a reflection of the person who chooses him. Thus, for sisters who wish to marry, we should ask ourselves, “Am I deserving of a pious man? How shall I improve my <em>aqeedah</em> for the sake of Allah (SWT)? How do I represent Islam as a Muslim woman? If I truly wish for a husband who is as pious as Prophet Muhammad (SAW), am I practicing my religion at the same level as Khadijah (RA), to provide his favours in return?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>The Prayer to make a Choice</strong></span><br />
When a marriage proposal ensues, the prayer of <em>Istikarah</em> &#8211; a two raka’ah prayer with a specific du’a &#8211; is always recommended for guidance to help us make such an important life decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The<em> Istikarah</em> prayer was a Prophetic Sunnah when asking a favour from Allah (SWT). The essence of the prayer and the invocations that follow include: acknowledging that Allah (SWT) has all knowledge and power in the dunya and hereafter, whereas we do not; Acknowledging that only Allah (SWT) knows best of decision that we make, and we do not. We thus, ask Allah (SWT) to guide us to the decision that would benefit our iman and taqwa. And lastly, it is through<em> Istikarah</em> that we ask Allah (SWT) to turn us away from decisions that may harm us and give us strength to take another route, insha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>The Better Half of Me</strong></span><br />
Choosing a spouse is a reflection of ourselves. And choosing a person to spend our entire life with will require constant self-reflection. What type of person do I want to spend my life with? How do I ensure I choose character over chemistry or material wealth? What can I do to better myself as a wife for the sake of Allah (SWT)? How will our union be pleasing to Allah (SWT)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However one looks at it, choosing your other half is a crucial stepping stone on the journey called marriage; a journey we share with that one other important person with the goal of Jannah as our final resting destination, insha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we make the choice of who to marry, who will be our other half, we must – with the guidance and knowledge of Allah (SWT) – make the best decisions. Doing so will not only give a promising start to our marriage, but also complete half of  our faith.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Shahin Vohra explores the rewarding, yet challenging, nature of our relationship with our elderly parents.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the moment our children are old enough to ask about life, we muse at their adorability in questions such as “Who made me? Where did you get me from?” Such innocence is evidence of the natural belief every child has that they have come from someone else. That child knows they belong to their parents and we instill in them that there is a greater Master to whom we all belong. A lot of how we are with our children resonates with our relationships with our own parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of Allah’s (SWT) most absolute decrees, as mentioned in Surat Al-Isra, speaks of the rights of our parents. In particular Surat Al-Isra’s salient verse “wa qadha rabbuka alla ta’budu illa iyyahu wa bilwalidayni ihsana (your Lord has decreed that you worship Him alone and that you show ihsan to your parents)”. The rights of parents are second only to the rights of Allah (SWT) and this verse beautifully highlights how sacred these rights are. Why are we commanded to do good to our parents? Because they once did the same for us, on a far grander scale. Our Lord knows that when it is our turn to repay our parents, this could never be as pure or miraculous as the devotion we received from them. It is indeed a test from our Rabb and the path that may lead us to Jannah, insha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our parents provide that base to which we float in good times and bad &#8211; often being our “rock”. But it is not always the case that we remain loyal to our parents and there is no guarantee that we will always get on or even agree with them. In the first of this two part series, I have interviewed two women who have elderly parents whom they now care for. Both these women exemplify how relationships with parents evolve and indeed take their own twists and turns as we find our way through this life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadia (pen name) is a 35-year-old mother of three children. Sadia had been caring for her father, who suffered with Alzheimer’s disease for 10 years and passed away at the end of 2013. Rayhaana (pen name) is a 27-year-old singleton. She lives with and cares for her elderly parents. I am grateful to both these sisters for their honesty and willingness to be interviewed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba048a;"><strong><em>How would you describe your relationship with your parents?</em></strong></span><br />
Sadia: I have become very close to my mother in the last few years, more so since caring for my father alongside her. I was always a “daddy’s girl”. Even though he forgot me towards the end, couldn’t even recognise me anymore, I still felt that somewhere inside he knew I was his little girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rayhaana: I wouldn’t say I am totally connected to my parents, but I have become closer to them since my elder two sisters married and moved away. I have definitely learnt to understand my parents more as I have got older. I still struggle to agree with some of their values and beliefs which I see as cultural rather than religious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba048a;"><strong><em>Were there ever difficult or strained times between you and your parents?</em></strong></span><br />
Sadia: Alhamdulillah I have always got on well with my parents. However, once I was married and had my own family, I guess I did become complacent in my duties towards them. I was very busy and always expected my parents to just be there really. We all like to think our parents are invincible, don’t we? So it was a wake-up call when dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rayhaana: Strained would be an understatement! My elder sisters were the model daughters. They did the “right” course at university, they were married at the “right” age to the “right” spouse chosen by our parents. I was the black sheep. Always rebelling. I could never understand why I wasn’t allowed to make my own decisions; after all, it is my life, right? I wanted to be able to live it my way. This issue about “my rights” really became a sticking point between my parents and me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #ba048a;"><strong><em>How did you deal with the issues between you and your parents?</em></strong></span><br />
Sadia: I always felt guilty that I wasn’t doing enough for my parents. As dad’s health deteriorated, I had to change my priorities in life so that I could be there for him. It was tough having three young children, a husband and a home to manage. I had to put my career plans on hold. But Allah (SWT) always showed me a way through. I just put all my wishes to the side and focused my energies on making sure mum was supported and dad had the best care I could give him. Often I’d feel like I was neglecting my own children, but I knew my dad wasn’t getting better and wouldn’t always be there. That thought kept me striving harder to do the best for him. I’m not perfect and there were days when I wished I could just go on holiday or start my job again and then I’d get very sad. I just prayed so hard to Allah (SWT) to lift me up and alhamdulillah He always did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rayhaana: My rebellion against my parents reached its height when my father told me he would disown me if I married a white Muslim revert whom I had chosen as a life partner. I was 21 years old. At the time I couldn’t believe my father was being so harsh with me. After months of battling, I backed down. I felt bitter that I had to sacrifice my happiness for my parent’s cultural beliefs. I became distant with the whole family, especially my father. I wouldn’t participate in any family gatherings and I hardly spoke with my parents. I threw myself into my career and actually did quite well, which kept me sane I guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba048a;"><strong><em>Do you feel you could have done things differently at the time?</em></strong></span><br />
Sadia: I wish I&#8217;d been easier on myself at the time. The guilt of not being there enough for mum and dad, for neglecting my children, for not having enough time for my husband &#8211; it all just kept eating away at me. I then started going through days on auto-pilot and I wish I’d cherished the little things more instead of fretting about what else had to be done and how I was going to manage. Looking back now, even helping to feed and change dad was enormously rewarding for me. If only I could have captured those moments somehow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rayhaana: The biggest regret I have is failing to understand the reasons why my father made the decisions he did where my life was concerned. Instead of becoming bitter, I should have spoken with him. I doubt he ever would have agreed to my chosen life partner, but I should have given his views and opinions more importance than I did at the time. I prayed istikharah many times back then and I should have accepted my father’s refusal as the answer to my istikharah, because there were too many obstacles in the way of the marriage and I’m now certain that was Allah’s (SWT) way of telling me it wasn’t right for me. But hindsight is 20/20, isnt it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what changes in the lives of these two women and indeed their relationships with their parents that makes them come almost full circle back to those who brought them into this world? In the second part of my interview next month, we will explore the natural fitrah gifted to us by Allah (SWT) as Sadia and Rayhaana reveal their yearning to be close to their parents.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[J. Samia Mair shares her secret weirdness that is embarrassing yet endearing to her family members]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Muuuum!”, one of my daughters drags out my name extra long as I am teaching a homeschool co-op class. “Do you have to…do you have to&#8230;” she struggles to find just the right words. “Do you have to be so, so you!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that I must have gone over my quota of embarrassing statements, gestures or idiosyncrasies for a child on the cusp of teens. It’s okay that she comments lovingly at home that we are a weird family, but that apparently is our little family secret, not to be shared, and especially not to be shared with her peers. I look at her, and she gives me that look that she is serious. Her twin sister is silent, showing no emotion. I’m not sure if that is because she doesn’t care what I do or if she is even paying attention. Some of the other kids giggle. I continue to teach, and my embarrassed daughter makes no more comments for the rest of the class. I’m not sure if it is because I stopped embarrassing her or if she just gave up. After all, being me just comes naturally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
To be fair, she has a point. We have a homeschool co-op that requires each member to teach one or two classes a year. The classes meet once a week and last seven weeks. Putting together a curriculum and teaching the classes takes a lot of time to do right. There is the added pressure that you are teaching your friends’ kids and you love them like nieces and nephews. You want the classes to be educational and entertaining; you want them to like your class. Generally the kids spare no feelings. If they are not enjoying the class, you will hear about it one way or another. Feedback is definitely not a problem. So, when the classes are over, there is a sense of relief and it frees up a lot of time for other things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year at co-op I did the unthinkable. I have a dance. It is my happy dance. It is a dance that I cannot replicate at will. I have tried, but my family continues to tell me that I never have it right. It is visceral and comes from my soul, unexpectedly. It doesn’t happen every time I’m happy, only at certain times, and I have not figured out which happy times trigger the dance and which do not. I don’t even realise that I am doing it until I am moving across the floor &#8211; and by that time, it is too late. So I guess you can figure out what happened. The class I was teaching ended; the kids left the room, which is on the first floor of the masjid, and I followed them out and then proceeded to do my happy dance down the hallway. Now, Allah (SWT) is Merciful because most of my class and the kids from other classes were heading in the opposite direction. Only a few mums and maybe a couple of kids witnessed the spectacle. Yes, there was laughter, and yes, there was embarrassment on my end, and of course my children were mortified. Who could blame them? Things didn’t get any better when I explained what they just witnessed was my “happy dance” and what my “happy dance” was. The damage was done and at least one daughter’s memory is long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
But I know I’m not alone. The other members of my immediate family have their own weird propensities that they would not want me to share &#8211; so tempted as I am, I will resist. I grew up in another family, a non-Muslim family, with its special brand of weirdness. Occasionally, friends will share their own private weirdnesses. I suspect, but of course do not know, that each family has its little secrets, those little endearing moments that strengthen the bonds among family members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
One of my favourite stories from the Seerah concerns our beloved Messenger’s (SAW) wife whom he (SAW) married shortly after Khadijah’s (RA) death, Saudah bint Zamah (RA). She was older than his other wives and apparently a big woman with a somewhat distinctive and peculiar walk. She knew that her walk would make the Prophet (SAW) smile so she would play up on that in order to bring the Prophet (SAW) joy. Some people might think her walk was weird, but she was loved for it, and she used it to express her love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Love is blind”, it is said. But I’m not sure that accurately reflects what is happening. It is not that we do not see the faults or idiosyncrasies or weirdness in those we love. Indeed, who is better to know these things than those who are closest to us? It seems to me that all of these things make each of us who we are: the good, the not-so-good, and the special about us. It is the package that we appreciate and love in each other &#8211; it is the package that others might not see. So, I would not say that “love is blind,” but rather “love is piercing”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This does not mean that there are no aspects of ourselves where we could improve and that our families would like us to improve and that we should improve. Each of us is a flawed, a human work in progress, but hopefully with Allah’s (SWT) Mercy we are trying to become a better servant to Him I and in the process, helping those whom we love to do the same. So, when my daughter asks me, “Do you have to be so, so you?” I can honestly answer, “Well, yes &#8211; and no.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Catherine Clarke gives an introduction to keeping the family’s teeth in tip top condition.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago, I didn&#8217;t understand what all the fuss was about going to the dentist. I&#8217;d pop along every year or two; teeth would get a quick check-up followed by a scale and polish, and I&#8217;d be out the door in about 15 minutes &#8211; done. That all changed a few years ago when I had my first fillings &#8211; three in total &#8211; one of which was particularly deep. I also had a bit of gum recession on one tooth. I finally understood what an uncomfortable place a dentist&#8217;s chair can be, how sensitive the nerves in my teeth are and what a horrible sensation it is to have a drill in my mouth!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did I get to this point? I thought I had done everything right &#8211; with fairly regular check-ups and brushing twice a day. At the time I thought it was the old wives tale about losing a tooth with every pregnancy coming true. Being honest with myself, I realised that my changing habits were more to blame, rather than the fact that I was now a mother. I had given in to my sweet tooth, and certainly was snacking on more biscuits than ever before, having grown up in a biscuit free house! I certainly think that more sugar in my diet was a major factor. I also drank fizzy drinks on a more regular basis than I had in the past. With both my own, and now my children&#8217;s dental health to consider I needed to go back to basics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know about brushing twice a day for at least two minutes, yet even in researching this article I came across some information I&#8217;d previously been unaware of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb8888;"><strong>Simple tips for all the family:</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;"> •</span> Use a soft bristled toothbrush and brush gently for the recommended two minutes to remove plaque and prevent gum recession.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">• </span>Don&#8217;t brush your teeth for at least an hour after eating. This is because the acid produced in the mouth after eating takes time to be neutralised by saliva. Brushing sooner than this causes increased erosion of your teeth&#8217;s enamel.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">• </span>Don&#8217;t use mouthwash after brushing, use it at a different time such as after lunch.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">• </span>Pay more attention to the frequency with which you consume sugary drinks and foods, rather than with the quantities consumed, as reducing the amount of time your teeth are exposed to sugar is the key.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">•</span> Drink fizzy or sugary drinks through a straw to minimise contact with teeth.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">•</span> Eat cheese or drink milk after a meal to reduce the acid in the mouth.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">•</span> Sugar free gum helps to produce saliva which is the mouth&#8217;s own acid neutraliser and should be chewed for 20 minutes after meals.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">•</span> No sugary foods and drinks within one hour of bedtime.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">•</span> Milk and water are the safest drinks for teeth. Limit fruit juice to mealtimes and try to only drink one glass a day.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">•</span> Dried fruit is high in sugar and inclined to stick to teeth so should be limited as a snack.<br />
<span style="color: #eb8888;">•</span> Rinse your mouth with water after eating or drinking something sugary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb8888;"><strong>Flossing</strong></span><br />
While most people remember to brush their teeth, flossing can be neglected. It is important to floss once a day to prevent gum disease in particular. A little bleeding at first is normal if you are not used to flossing; however, if it continues, speak to your dentist. It&#8217;s important to use the correct technique to prevent damaging your gums. Floss harps can be useful if you are not used to flossing, and can be good for children also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gum disease develops painlessly and recently has been linked to a number of serious conditions including diabetes, stroke, heart disease, poor pregnancy outcomes and even dementia.[i] While more research is needed, it&#8217;s worth being aware that oral health can impact other aspects of our health. The same is true in reverse &#8211; good general health supports good oral health. A healthy diet and lifestyle (no smoking, limiting alcohol) is one of the keys to preventing tooth decay and gum disease. Also it&#8217;s worth remembering that gum disease is a major cause of tooth loss among adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb8888;"><strong>Children&#8217;s teeth</strong></span><br />
Even baby (milk) teeth need to be brushed regularly and be well looked after. Properly maintained baby teeth guide the adult teeth into the correct position. It&#8217;s a good idea to take children with you to dental appointments as early as practically possible so they get used to the idea. At about three years of age they can start to have their own appointments. I think it&#8217;s important to choose a good dentist who has a warm, child-friendly manner and is patient and willing to spend a bit of time cajoling the reluctant child. I was blessed to find such a dentist recently. She chatted to my children &#8211; who were a bit unsure at first &#8211; and my son even ended the appointment by giving her a hug and a picture he&#8217;d drawn. As we all know, these early experiences are crucial and set the tone for lifelong habits. My husband had a very negative experience with a dentist as a child and will still only see one when it becomes absolutely necessary. Asking friends for recommendations of dentists they&#8217;ve seen can be a good way to find a suitable one. Also, the NHS has a feature on their website which allows you to rate your dentist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that my son had a certain amount of anxiety about loose teeth and teeth falling out, so we decided to give him a small present every time he lost a tooth &#8211; although he was clear it wasn&#8217;t left by a fairy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb8888;"><strong>Natural toothpastes</strong></span><br />
Fluoride remains a controversial substance for some, although found in all the mainstream toothpastes. I recently switched to natural products in place of shampoos and shower gels, with good results so a natural toothpaste would be something I&#8217;d consider. The Wellness Mama website has a number of different recipes. Also, the benefits of miswak or siwak are well known amongst Muslims. Studies have shown that with correct use, they are more effective at removing plaque and preventing gum disease than conventional toothbrushes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With our children we&#8217;ve got a great opportunity to safeguard their oral health and instil lifelong good habits. For ourselves, it&#8217;s never too late to halt the deterioration that may have already occurred. Again the Wellness Mama website has some ideas for actually &#8216;remineralising&#8217; damaged teeth. With better oral hygiene and dental care these days, it&#8217;s realistic to imagine keeping our own teeth for life bi-idhnillah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Klaudia Khan shares some green wisdom from her senior relatives.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our elders have a lot of wisdom to share with us, but we are not always ready to listen to them. They may give us good advice based on their knowledge and experience, but we stubbornly insist on learning from our own mistakes. Then, at some point, we realise that they were right and had we listened to them earlier, we would have saved ourselves lots of trouble. With my newly developed eco-consciousness, I have come to recognise and appreciate the guidance given to me by my parents, grandparents and in-laws, who often lead green lifestyles without even realising. For them, green choices that we consciously make and often struggle to keep are just normal, common-sense decisions. They were raised in the pre-consumerist era, when people truly led a sustainable lifestyle and wastage could not be afforded. The world around them has changed and the standards have changed too; the new philosophy of ever-wanting-more has affected everyone. However, the ideals that were instilled in their minds at a young age &#8211; the principles of truly sustainable life in harmony with nature &#8211; still guide them and can be lessons for us, too. That is, once we get over our infatuation with the fast, modern, careless lifestyle. Let me share with you some re-discovered pearls of green wisdom from my elders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“The best vegetables are the ones that grow in your own garden. The carrots from the shop just look too good to be truly good” &#8211; my late father, Zbigniew.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was blessed to grow up in a house with a huge garden which my father lovingly cultivated and which supplied our kitchen with lots of vegetables, herbs, greens and fruit. I did not appreciate it at the time and the only time I could be seen in the garden was when the strawberries were ripe – eating them straight from the patch! I used to find excuses to avoid any work in the garden and now I regret that I missed the chance to learn gardening from my father. Now I’m trying to grow some herbs on the windowsill of my flat in England, but it turns out  it’s not as easy as I thought. I miss my family house and garden in Poland and the taste of real, natural vegetables and fruit freshly picked from the patch!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“If I don’t know it, I don’t eat it” </em><em>&#8211; my maternal grandmother, Janina.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes in the supermarket I get tempted to look for a creamy cake or fancy chocolate dessert, but when I look at the ingredient list to make sure it’s halal or vegetarian, I see a list too long to be read standing in the aisle and blocking the way &#8211; I feel I should be a scientist to understand it! I’d imagine cake is made from flour and eggs and butter and sugar, but I cannot even imagine what half of the ingredients listed on the box would look like. So I put that box back on the shelf, remembering my granny’s motto, and look for something more familiar. Eating only what I know does not mean that I would not try new dishes, but it means that I would try to eat foods made from good natural products, nothing concocted, derived or modified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Why would someone give their children all this vitamin-enriched rubbish? Give them good pure ghee and wholemeal foods and they will have all the vitamins they need” </em><em>&#8211; my mother-in-law, Naheed.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On every box of children’s cereal or sweet yoghurt you can read information like ‘Vitamin D is important for your bones’ or ‘Contains vitamins and minerals’. Yes, lots of these products might be artificially enriched in vitamins and minerals, but predominantly they consist of sugar and often artificial colours and flavours. The big sweets manufacturers and the TV have spoilt our children’s diet and even convinced us that something as high in sugar as a bowl of sugary Frosties might be a healthy breakfast! My mother-in-law feeds her grandchildren with lots of love and some wholemeal parathas fried in pure clarified butter and served with free-range eggs. Now, this I can trust to be a healthy breakfast! But I have to admit it’s just recently that I realised the truth about highly processed and highly sweetened foods that are often marketed as ‘healthy’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Make it a habit to turn off the lights” &#8211; my father-in-law, Niaz.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turning off the lights is such an obvious eco-conscious practice. It is so easy to switch off the lamp when leaving the room. And it is equally easy to forget it. I used to forget and leave the microwave oven on standby and my father-in-law used to remind me every day to turn it off. And his continuous reminders really did help me in developing a habit of switching it off and it also extended to checking all other appliances and lights in the kitchen. So much energy and water is wasted without us realising and we are not in the habit of saving it. So it does need a conscious decision to make a change and it needs some perseverance and discipline to develop good green habits &#8211;  something elders do understand to be important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“You never know what you are going to need” &#8211; my late father, Zbigniew.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father didn’t like throwing away things and he was great at fixing things and doing everything himself, from building our family house to growing his own vegetables to making a kitchen table from re-used wood. In our home, books and toys that were damaged were always fixed – not thrown away or replaced. My father even used to fix our shoes if they needed some stitches or a bit of glue to hold the sole on properly. In the world of fast fashion and easy bargains, these practices may seem eccentric, but older generations were blessed to grow up in times when things had their value and you didn’t just go shopping to kill time. For them, money might have been the biggest issue, but even if we are not restricted financially we should at least remember now that the planet, its delicate ecosystem and its precious resources are the biggest issue. So now I do fix my children’s  broken toys and torn books, and I even fixed my daughter’s slipper’s broken sole with a bit of superglue! I’m a frugal mother and proud &#8211; just like my father would wish me to be!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“If you buy something and pay all that money, then buy something good and solid” &#8211; my maternal grandmother Janina.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My grandmother would scorn the purchases of some fast fashion shoes, saying that they looked as if they would only last five minutes. This is not how she would have spent her money; she would think it’s better to buy a quality pair of shoes that would last more than a season than to buy three and throw them all away when the season ends. In her youth, she used to save money to buy good shoes. There were fewer shops and less to choose from, but the produce was of better quality and therefore had its price. In those days, there were no sweatshops supplying customers in rich countries with fast fashion at the expense of poorer countries’ resources and human lives. Also, people used to buy things when they really needed them, when what they had could not be fixed any more, and so there was minimal wastage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Why buy water when it comes clean and free from the tap?” – my late father, Zbigniew.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Producing one gallon of bottled water takes two gallons to make it and most of the plastic bottles end up in the landfills or floating in the seas. Our parents and grandparents had too much common sense to buy bottled water no different to water coming from the tap. We, too, should be smarter than the bottled water producers would like us to be and drink tap water instead!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living an eco-conscious life may seem hard at times, but in reality we are very privileged these days; we have so much choice &#8211; much more than our elders used to have. Being thankful for what we are blessed with is yet another green lesson to be learnt from them, insha Allah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Klaudia Khan believes a slow start is the best start when it comes to the post-partum period.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My baby daughter is sleeping as I open my computer to write. I had better not waste time because I know that the minute she wakes up, she will demand my attention. Alhamdulillah she is six weeks old now, and it is hard to believe that so much time has passed since I saw her first, born on a cold winter night in Leeds hospital. She has learnt so much since that day: to smile and to sit quietly for 15 minutes in her bouncer; she has learnt not to be afraid of taking a bath, and she has learnt not to fall asleep during feeding. And what about me? I have learnt that post-partum rest, and not necessarily confinement, is very important, and it is my right that I should not give up. It’s the first time I took it seriously and now, as my 40 days have passed, I feel I have had good rest, and I’m ready to take on my usual duties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of my three daughters were born in Europe and so I have also succumbed to the ideal of the super-mum, fit and fine just a day after. Well, I was not really fit and fine, but because I believed I should be, I felt that I was not up to standard and so felt stressed about having to rely on the help of my family. I tried to keep the house as clean as usual and cook dinner as always, not letting myself rest properly and not giving my newborn babies as much time as I felt I should and wanted. I did what I thought others expected of me, completely unaware that it was my right to take things slowly, and it was completely fine to let others take over the management of the household. It was only as I prepared myself for the birth of my third child that I learnt and realised the importance of the post-partum rest, and so far this has been my most relaxed and stress-free period. I let my mother cook all the meals without a shade of guilt, and I have not protested once about my husband cleaning the house. There are toys strewn all over the floor, but I don’t care any more. I’m happy and so are all three of my children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the family village of my husband in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, women are expected to stay at home for 40 days after giving birth to a baby, they don’t do any housework and they are cared for by the female members of their extended family. They eat what is considered ‘soft foods’ and are also given a special dish of nuts, grains and poppy seeds that is meant to strengthen their backs. Having inherited no tradition of post-partum confinement from my own Polish culture, I was happy to adopt the Pashtun way. Except the diet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While preparing for childbirth, I read Sheila Kitzinger’s ‘Rediscovering Childbirth’. On post-partum rest, she writes about the forgotten tradition of ‘god-sibs’ &#8211; the women-helpers, who are supposed to assist a woman in the days preceding the labour and in the weeks after &#8211; the tradition perhaps re-emerging in the form of doulas. We read about the importance of building a sanctuary, in the literal or symbolic sense, around the mother and her newborn baby, and how it is still practised in some traditional societies, and how it becomes forgotten or sometimes reinvented in certain other cultures. Kitzinger writes about the disapproval of Western expectations towards new mothers by Asian migrant communities, who wonder how ‘women in the West can get straight out of bed after giving birth like hens laying eggs.’ We also hear complaints of some of the new mothers who dislike the restrictive diet that is prescribed for women in their post-partum period by their local traditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet it seems that in most developed, industrialised countries, this truth of the need for post-partum rest has been forgotten &#8211; women are expected to be back up on their feet just a few days after giving birth. They are also assumed to be able to care for their babies on their own from the beginning and be back in shape wearing their pre-pregnancy tight jeans just weeks after. Women’s magazines are full of pictures showing celebrities who have achieved just that, while on the other hand, the TV portrays new mothers as poor exhausted and misshapen creatures, walking around a messy house in stained pyjamas and avoiding the forever crying baby. The first weeks with the new baby are always a bit of a challenge, but don’t have to be a nightmare!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Islamic teachings, during the post-partum period lasting up to forty days we are exempt from the prayer and fasting, and we should also refrain from having an intimate relationship with our husband. Once the bleeding stops, we should take the ritual bath and re-establish our prayer. There are no specific instructions regarding home confinement or what we should or should not do during this period, yet the special role of a woman as a mother and the significance of breastfeeding the baby, as well as the importance of preserving our health, all support the idea of post-partum rest. It is also a custom among many Muslim societies for a woman to spend her post-partum period at home, being taken care of by her mother, mother-in-law or other female relatives, refraining from housework and focusing on bonding with the baby. Actually, it used to be the norm everywhere that women would spend the first weeks after giving birth resting and recovering. After all, the wellbeing of the mother is consequential to the wellbeing of the baby and should be treated with equal importance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
From my experiences, reading Kitzinger&#8217;s book and of course from my deen, I know that post-partum rest is my right, not my invented whim &#8211; and there is also no one way of doing it right. One thing is sure, you are already a Superwoman by bringing a new baby into the world &#8211; you don’t need to prove it by giving up your post-partum rest. This is the time to regain your strength and of course, enjoy this precious time with your new baby.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[UmmSuhayb takes charge of her husband’s diet and finds that more food is the answer to pain-free weight loss.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally took my dear husband’s trousers to the charity shop. They had moved with us three times in the hope that they’d fit once again. Dear husband felt like it was just impossible to go down in weight. Indeed, the only way the weight seemed to be going was up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what appeared to be simply a typical familial pattern of enjoying too much oily or sweet food, or just altogether too much of it, coupled with little exercise, ended<br />
up with a change in trouser size. If you’re wearing traditional South Asian clothes, this is easily remedied by a Ioosening of the shalwar’s (trousers’) drawstring. However,<br />
this solution has serious drawbacks, including high cholesterol, diabetes and heart attacks. This was what took my father-in-law back to his Lord earlier than expected. We didn’t want patterns repeating themselves so something had to be done about the pounds that were gradually making their way onto my husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Wise words</strong></span><br />
Sometimes it can be really hard to take action on the advice we are given. You are probably familiar with the following hadith regarding the eating habits of a Muslim:<br />
The Prophet (SAW) said: “No human being fills a container to worse effect than he fills his own stomach. It is sufficient for a human being to have a few bites to keep himself fit. If he must eat, then let him use one third for food, one third for drink and one third for breathing”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But food can sometimes be just too delicious, habits too hard to do away with. Although my husband was aware there was a problem and wanted to lose weight, none of the methods you commonly hear about &#8211; Weight-watchers, cabbage diets, Cambridge diets &#8211; appealed to him. But then TV, normally a waste of time and a good way to put on weight whilst vegetating in front of it, actually gave some impetus for a change. We were watching a few lifestyle and diet programmes and one in particular gave some workable inspiration. Although we did not follow the show’s recommendations to the letter, the general principles proved invaluable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993366;">The Amazing Shrinking Husband ‘diet’</span></strong><br />
So here is how my husband managed to lose about 15 kg (33 pounds or well over two stones). Now that I think about it, this is about the weight of my 2 year old son!<br />
Read on as I reveal for you, dear reader, the secret to how my nearest and dearest became the Amazing Shrinking Husband. As he put it: ‘You have to change your mental attitude so that you don’t feel that you are on some kind of a diet. Rather you should think of having a healthy-eating lifestyle and pampering yourself with good stuff.’ In other words, eat abundantly of all the nutritious foods out there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The science behind it is that your body has a need for certain vitamins, minerals and nutrients and, if all you are giving it is junk, you will have to eat much more of the<br />
rubbish food to be satisfied nutritionally. At the same time, you will ingest many more unhealthy fats, sugar and refined carbohydrates and, as a result, you become overweight and feel terrible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993366;">Food, glorious food</span></strong><br />
The good news is, there are some foods you can scoff (almost) to your heart’s content:<br />
• any fruit (try smoothies, into which you can even add nuts/seeds/avocado/low fat yoghurt)<br />
• any vegetables (although it is best to minimise potato intake)<br />
• nuts (but avoid salted varieties and watch out for added oils)<br />
• wholegrain rice, couscous, quinoa, pasta, and oats<br />
• lentils and beans<br />
• fish, seafood (shrimps apparently contain a lot of cholesterol so minimise their use)<br />
• chicken in moderation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the no-nos:<br />
• Eat red meat only occasionally<br />
• Minimise bread intake<br />
• Keep fast food for an occasional treat</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong></span><br />
Changing the way you cook can also help to melt away the pounds. When cooking, preferably use olive or rapeseed oil. Always try to include extra vegetables and a side<br />
salad so that your overall meal size ends up being quite large. That way, you mentally feel you’ve had enough to eat as well as giving yourself a boost of the good stuff!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A firm favourite evening meal at our place is avocado with lemon juice for a starter, and oven-baked mackerel in a onion and garlic tomato sauce with brown rice and peas, served with a side salad, as the main course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Snacking is a stealthy cause of weight gain and you can catch it out by making sure your snacks contain the good stuff. If you feel peckish during the day, try a big plate of<br />
chopped fruits, some dates and some seeds or nuts. Eat as much as you want until you feel satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another tip is to eat early in the evening, not much later than 6 p.m. Any later and the food will sit in your stomach while you are sleeping and lead to a less restful night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of drinks, my husband had his drink (preferably water) a while after eating to allow your digestive juices to work to full effect. In that way he could get maximum<br />
nutrition from the food he eats. Avoiding caffeine has also helped to reduce my husband’s weight. We managed to acquire a taste for rooibos tea, even some of the children. Rooibos (redbush) tea is caffeine-free, contains anti-oxidants and generally relaxes you. Along with the cuppa, a couple of pieces of dark chocolate did<br />
not result in any disappointing weighin’s!. The Scientific evidence is out there that chocolate contains for example, antioxidants, and can reduce blood pressure,(although much of the research was sponsored by well-known chocolate manufacturers!). Just make sure it’s a couple of pieces, not bars!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993366;">Get moving!</span></strong><br />
As with most weight loss plans, dietary changes need to be combined with exercise. In my husband’s case, he went jogging a few times a week. However, I must say that the dietary changes seemed to make the most difference. Despite relatives initially thinking he was too thin and not ‘healthy’, I think they have grown used to him being slightly less chubby. I hope this change also gives any future grandchildren a greater chance of getting to know their grandfather, an opportunity our children did not have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you too are looking to lose weight, don’t think less, think more (of the good things you’ve been provided), and maybe some shrinking will come about!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
N.B. Please consult your Doctor/ Medical Practitioner before making any radical changes to your diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Allah (SWT) says: <strong><span style="color: #993366;">‘O you who believe! Eat of the good things which We have provided for you.’</span></strong> (2:172)</h3>

<p>“I think I’m having a heart attack,” Maryam said calmly to her parents one night. “I can’t breathe.” It had been just a few weeks since ten-year old Maryam found out she would be leaving everything she knew behind and moving to a new country. The routines and monotony of daily life, which she had grown accustomed to, were soon replaced by big brown boxes and talk of their new home in a Kuwaiti desert compound. For Maryam, a shy introvert, the thought of leaving her school and her friends overwhelmed her with sadness. Yet, she was intrigued by her parents’ excitement, so one evening Maryam picked up a booklet they often referred to which described Kuwait, the desert compound and the available amenities. To her horror, she came across a page with the word “Warning” sprawled across the top. She read the text carefully, making a mental note of the instructions to ‘be careful and alert, to report suspicious activity and to stay within designated safe areas to avoid potential land mines and bombs’. It was not long before Maryam lost her appetite, had trouble sleeping, and began experiencing chest pain and distressed breathing.</p>

<p>Maryam ended up in the Emergency Room that night with an oxygen mask covering her mouth and nose. After a thorough check-up, doctors were unable to identify a physical cause for her symptoms and suggested that she was experiencing stress-related panic attacks. Maryam’s story raises a number of questions: Do children experience stress for similar reasons and exhibit similar symptoms as stressed adults? What role does stress play in child development? What can parents do to manage or diffuse the stressors in their children’s lives? To better understand childhood stress, I spoke with Noha Alshugairi, a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and Certified Positive Discipline Trainer from Newport Beach, California.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c2a267;"><em><strong>JE: Maryam was a healthy child with no prior physical, psychological, or emotional problems. What happened to her and why?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>NA: Children ages five to twelve years are concerned with three major questions: Is the world safe and dependable? What am I capable of? How does the world operate? Any causes that lead to negative perceptions in these three major areas will lead to stress. In Maryam’s case, the warnings she read about threatened her sense of safety and further fuelled her anxiety about moving. Another example is if a child is born to a depressed mother who is not taking care of herself and is constantly unavailable; the child may grow up believing the world to be unsafe and undependable because his or her basic needs are not being met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c2a267;"><em><strong>JE: Do children experience stress for similar reasons as adults?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>NA: Children’s needs are concrete and limited to their immediate world. They lack the ability to understand long-term consequences of events and actions, and hence they are not likely to worry about the same issues that worry adults. That being said, children will pick up on their parents’ anxieties or react more strongly to trauma if their parents do. Caregivers send cues to children about what is safe and what is not. It is therefore important that adults monitor the issues they discuss and the manner in which they discuss them when children are present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c2a267;"><strong><em>JE: Maryam exhibited several physical symptoms of stress. Is this common among children?</em></strong></span></p>
<p>NA: Children’s symptoms in reaction to stress manifest in several ways depending on the child and the family context. They include physical symptoms such as stomach and headaches, bedwetting, and loss of appetite. Concentration and behavioural problems, regression in the accomplishment of milestones, nightmares, and feelings of guilt and anxiety are also common. Some children may exhibit intense clinginess when separated from caregivers while in others the opposite will occur in the form of disconnection and detachment from important figures in their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c2a267;"><em><strong>JE: Are there any benefits to childhood stress? For example, does stress help to build resilient children, capable of better coping with future stress?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>NA: If what we mean by childhood stress is that which is related to normal child development such as worries about a test, a game, or a relationship with a friend, then these stresses can be a significant source of resilience if parents teach healthy coping skills. Resilience is built when children sometimes succeed and sometimes fail. If a parent is pushing a child to study hard and never finds the child’s efforts satisfactory, then this situation is not conducive to building resilience. If there is an expectation that the child needs to achieve every single time, then this child will grow up seeking perfection which could lead to stress and anxiety. However, if the parent is encouraging the child to study to the best of their ability and then is comforting no matter what the test results are, then this could be a source of resiliency. I must emphasise that defects in basic childhood needs for safety, belonging, and love do not build resilience; they lead to pathological problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c2a267;"><strong><em>JE: What three things do you recommend parents do to prevent and manage stress in their children?</em></strong></span></p>
<p>NA: First, routines, routines, routines. I cannot emphasise the importance of having a consistent routine. Routines provide structure, safety and dependability. If a child is aware and knows what to expect in his or her daily life, this child is less likely to feel stressed and anxious. Routines are not always easy for parents to follow and implement. Nowadays, parents are so busy scheduling every minute of their child’s day to the detriment of the child. Routines need to include some downtime where kids are free to do what they like to do. Second, consistent care-giving. It is critical for healthy development that a child is cared for primarily (meaning most but not necessarily all of the time) by one adult. Changing the care-giver of a child frequently disrupts his or her sense of security and his ability to attach to people which leads to stress and anxiety. Finally, love and affection. Nothing can reassure a child more than knowing he or she is loved unconditionally. Parents beware: loving them conditionally, meaning “If you do this the way I told you to, I will love you” is a source of anxiety and stress for children, not to mention that it distorts their relationships later in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been seven years since Maryam’s visit to the Emergency Room. Despite her initial anxiety, Maryam remembers her two years living in Kuwait fondly. “It ended up being one of the best experiences in my life,” she says, “but I could not have known that when I was first told that we were moving. I am glad that my parents took my symptoms seriously, reassured me about the move, and sought professional help. I have grown a lot since then. I know how to recognise and manage my stress now &#8211; but I still need the support of family members and friends. I think we all do, regardless of our age.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Different mindsets about food can cause a rift in a marriage, explains Laura El Alam.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It had been a long day of errand running, toddler chasing and homeschooling. I sank gratefully down on the park bench next to my friend, and we settled in to watch our children play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She asked me, casually, &#8220;So, what are you making for dinner tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmmm. It was 4:30 p.m., and by the time we got home, it would be dinner time. That was a valid question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I admitted, &#8220;I&#8217;ll figure something out.&#8221; My mind drifted to the ubiquitous box of pasta that I always keep stocked in the pantry. I began to ponder what kind of sauce could I throw together in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friend, meanwhile, was looking at me incredulously. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know? But what will your husband say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to ignore the hint of disapproval in her voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I left for this play date,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I made sure to prepare the salads, marinate the chicken and measure out the rice and seasonings so that everything will be ready to go when we get home. I plan all my meals a week in advance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Salads, plural? I thought. A week in advance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the guilt hit me like a brick. Am I a negligent wife? My poor husband will be stuck, again, with &#8220;Noodle Surprise&#8221; for dinner, while other men will enjoy a three-course meal. My husband won&#8217;t complain, but I know deep in his heart, he will probably yearn for a more elaborate meal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has always been one of the biggest cultural gaps in my marriage: our different expectations of food. For my husband, sophisticated, multi-course meals were an integral part of his childhood. His mother&#8217;s cooking skills are amazing, masha Allah, and she regularly whips up dishes that could put a five-star restaurant to shame. Moroccan cuisine is complex and time-consuming. Over her lifetime, my mother-in-law must have spent thousands of hours in the kitchen, preparing immense and intricate meals for her family of nine. Like so many women, preparing delicious food is one of the main ways she displays her love for her family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, a child of the American convenience food &#8220;revolution&#8221; of the 70s and 80s, meals were often concocted in about 15 minutes and usually came from a box, can, microwave or freezer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I know that a home-cooked meal with fresh ingredients is far superior to the processed food I grew up with, I find it very difficult to make complicated meals like my mother-in-law&#8217;s. For one, I simply don&#8217;t have the time. Also, it&#8217;s impossible for me to reproduce her exact style of cooking, no matter how hard I try. After several failed attempts, I finally gave up trying to make a couscous that could pass muster with a true Moroccan. Come to think of it, most of my kitchen concoctions lack the flourish of a true gourmet. I have to admit the truth: I am a mediocre cook, and making meals for my family is a necessary task, but not a source of joy or fulfilment. I try to show my love for them in other ways. Does this make me a bad wife?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, I have learned that many other women have experiences similar to my own. Whether they grew up with a food-centred culture or not, whether they enjoy cooking or not, their current lifestyle makes preparing the delicacies that their husbands crave a huge burden. The different mindsets about food sometimes cause a great deal of discontent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t my wife make meals like my mother did? wonders the hungry husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When do I have the time? despairs the weary wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whereas our mothers, grandmothers or mothers-in-law often dedicated themselves almost exclusively to housework and cooking in particular, we women today have many other demands on our time. Some of us work part-time or full-time, by choice or necessity. Even without a job outside the home, the majority of modern mums have a very different child-rearing experience than the older generation. Gone are the days when children could play outside, unsupervised, for hours; now, most mothers must organise play dates and spend long chunks of time keeping a watchful eye on their kids. While the older generation usually stayed home, today&#8217;s mums are constantly on the go, taking kids to school, sports, appointments and extra-curricular activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educating our children is another demand on our time. A growing number of Muslim mums are choosing to home educate &#8211; a rewarding but very time-consuming task. Even those whose children attend traditional school frequently find themselves helping their kids with homework and projects. The after-school hours are often hectic for mums who must cook dinner, tend to a baby and explain algebra, simultaneously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, some men take for granted the fact that in their homelands, household servants were commonplace. In the background of their childhoods, there were often maids who were busy chopping vegetables, washing dishes and mopping floors. Men might not have been aware of those servants, but they did notice that their childhood home was always tidy, the meals served on time, the laundry clean. Sometimes their unconscious expectation is that their current home life will mirror that of their youth; however, not all modern families can afford to employ help. Fair wages for domestic help are quite expensive in most parts of the world, so families do without. Many women today have to manage their household without any help at all, not even the support of their mum or sisters, who often live far away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are modern wives to do? Put aside all other commitments to focus primarily on cooking? Serve Noodle Surprise five times a week? Memorise the number for pizza delivery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the answer, as always, is balance. While Muslims tend to glory in the consumption of food and consider it a &#8220;halal indulgence&#8221;, our deen teaches us moderation. The Prophet (SAW) said, &#8220;No human ever filled a container more evil than his belly. The few morsels needed to support his being shall suffice the son of Adam. But if there is no recourse, then one third for his food, one third for his drink and one third for his breath.&#8221;<em> (Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi)        </em><br />
According to another hadith, &#8220;Allah’s Messenger never found fault with food. If he liked something, he ate it, and if he disliked it, he just abstained from it.&#8221; <em>(Muslim)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Husbands should sympathise with their wives&#8217; many responsibilities and the limitations on their time. They should recognise that while food is necessary, elaborate meals are not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, wives who love their husbands will want to make them happy. Perhaps once a week we can take the time to prepare a meal that our husband especially loves. Asking his mum for cooking lessons will likely flatter her and could also help us master culinary tricks. For the rest of the week, a little Internet research into healthy, easy meals would be easy to do. We can even start an online forum with friends to share family-friendly recipes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We women have ever-increasing responsibilities, but we can take comfort in knowing that when we do our best for our families, Allah (SWT) will reward our efforts.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[J. Samia Mair reflects on the trials and triumphs of adopting and raising orphans.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Where’s my mother?” My 5-year-old asks pensively from her car seat in the back of our van.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She’s right here, silly,” her twin sister responds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No, I mean my real mother, my birth mother.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many adoptive parents, my daughter’s statement would cut right to the heart. Some parents discourage any questions about the birth family, threatened by their child’s desire to learn more. I know of one mother who told her adoptive son that his birth mother was dead, even though that was not true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I welcome my daughter’s question, happy that she wants to understand her history and grateful that she is able to ask me about it. As we drive to the masjid, I use the opportunity to discuss once again how they ended up in the United States with us, half a world away from the country of their birth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being an orphan begins with loss and there is no escaping that fact. In a perfect world, all children would be raised by their families. But the world is far from perfect and many orphans desperately need homes and families to love them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a photograph of the moment one of my daughters was handed to me. It is one of my most cherished possessions. As we and the other adoptive parents walk into the government building, we can hear babies crying. We listen carefully, wondering which of those voices will be coming home with us. My husband and I sit impatiently in the waiting room, having played this moment over and over again in our minds for years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly someone calls out from the hall, “Twins first!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband turns white and freezes. I wonder if he might faint. My heart beats quickly and I am unexpectedly nervous. Two government workers appear in the doorway, each holding an 11-month girl dressed in identical pink outfits. They look different from the “referral” photographs, which were taken when they were 4-months-old and which we had received only 6 weeks earlier. The girls are much bigger now and each has a complete head of hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are crying loudly, their faces bright red and stained with tears. They have never seen a non-Chinese person before and when they see the group of unfamiliar faces staring back at them, they cry even louder. They are especially terrified of the two strangers who are moving towards them with their arms outstretched to hold them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In the photograph, my arms are reaching for my daughter, my hands barely touching her petite, 16-pound body for the first time. Although she is tiny, her mouth is as wide open as she possibly can make it and she is howling. I, on the other hand, have a soft smile on my face and my expression shows absolute contentment. I had fallen in love 6-weeks earlier when I first saw her picture. She has yet to feel the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the hours pass, our daughters become more and more comfortable with us. Within days, they cling to us, not wanting anyone else to hold them. By the time we leave China, it is as if they had been with us all along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember landing in the United States. It was momentous. According to U.S. law, our girls were U.S. citizens the instant they stepped foot on U.S. soil. Our joy though was tempered with sorrow &#8211; the sorrow of knowing that our girls had left all that they had ever known and from now on would be pulled by two worlds. I also knew that on the other side of the world a mother wondered what had become of her two precious daughters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>The Adoption Process</strong></span><br />
Adoption is generally a long process and requires much sabr. At any point, it can fall through. It becomes even more complicated when dealing with a foreign country, which can change the adoption procedure and who qualifies to adopt, or even cancel the adoption with no warning or recourse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the United States, the easiest way to adopt for most families is to use an adoption agency and this is even more so for international adoption. The adoption agency ushers you along the process. The adoption specialists know the applicable laws, the documents that must be submitted, and where to submit them. Because so much of the responsibility is left to the adoption agency, it is essential to find a reputable agency and speak with others who have used it. A good agency will address problems as they arise &#8211; as they inevitably do &#8211; and offer the emotional and educational support that is needed. A bad agency can cost you an adoption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that the adoption agency does so much for you does not mean that you have it easy. The amount of paperwork required is daunting at first. Among other things, you need to get clearance from the police and child protective services that you do not have a criminal history or a record of child abuse or neglect. Your home is inspected by a social worker, the fire department, and the sanitation department. Prospective parents needs to submit a physician’s report, statement of net worth, verification of employment, tax return, copies of birth, marriage, and divorce certificates, and references. A social worker does an intensive interview with you, asking all sorts of personal questions. Many of the documents must be notarised, certificated and authenticated at the local, county, state and federal levels. All of this takes time and money. Yet, if you take a methodical and consistent approach to the paperwork, the process moves along steadily and, in retrospect, is not the impossible task you initially anticipated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you wait &#8211; often for years &#8211; until you have been “matched” with the child (or children) you are to adopt. It is an extremely emotional time with highs and lows. You worry that the adoption will not go through. You fantasize about your child. You likely will have to update and renew some of the documents. When you are finally matched, you have more paperwork to complete and must make travel arrangements and other preparations. For international adoption, the adoption agency arranges everything for you once you are in the foreign country and provides a guide to take you through the whole process there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our case, the long process and the years of waiting instantly vanished the moment we held our daughters, swept away by tears of joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Raising orphaned children </strong></span><br />
The biggest mistake adoptive parents can make is creating an environment where the child does not feel comfortable expressing his or her feelings about being orphaned and raised in a different family. In the not-so-distant past, it was believed in the United States that the best thing to do was to ignore the adoption all together. Many children did not find out that they were adopted until they were older, sometimes with tragic consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Islam, it would be haram to hide one’s orphan status as lineage is one of the five values that the Shari’ah is intended to uphold. A child must be able to grieve her loss. If she wants to try to track down her birth family when she is older, adoptive parents should support that decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents of internationally adopted children should teach their child about their birth country, including language lessons, and encourage the child to participate in cultural events. Experts also recommend that the child visits the birth country before puberty. Our girls will never be culturally Chinese but they can be proud to be Chinese Americans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents should not dwell on their child’s orphan status. A 30-year-old Korean adoptee emphasized that in a discussion with adoptive parents: adoption is only one aspect of who he is. Everybody faces challenges and no single challenge defines anybody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents raising orphans must be prepared to help the child deal with stigma, prejudice, and inappropriate questioning from strangers. Muslims who want to raise an orphan and can only do so through their country’s adoption laws should speak to a trusted Islamic scholar (and not just any imam) on what should be done to avoid violating Islam’s prohibition against adoption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much more can be said about raising orphans and each child will cope with being an orphan differently, even children within the same family. For some children, it is barely an issue, for others it is a lifelong challenge. Parents need to educate themselves and provided the guidance and support that is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day I came home to find my husband asleep on the couch with our two girls sleeping on either side of him. Their little arms and legs were wrapped around him, full of love for the Baba they adore so much. I watched them as they slept, grateful that Allah (SWT) has blessed us so generously. I also made du’a for their birth mother, praying that one day she will meet her beautiful daughters and know how much they are loved.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Jasmin Roberts walks you through 15 scenarios to help assess your relationship.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being in a relationship, particularly a good one, requires a measure of hard work and considerable calculation, yet few people are willing to make the necessary efforts to sustain a good relationship. Just as employees are regularly assessed and evaluated for theirs skills, attitude, and performance (and fired for a lack of said qualities), couples require the same level of self-evaluation and relationship assessment in order to maintain a healthy, working and efficient rapport. It&#8217;s easy to deflect our problems onto one another and play the blame game. It takes a rare and selfless person to say, &#8220;I may have been a jerk, and I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; instead of the oft-retorted &#8220;You&#8217;re the one&#8230; It&#8217;s you, it&#8217;s you, it&#8217;s you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet there are times when the blame does fall squarely on one person&#8217;s behaviour and their actions need to be called into account. Loving someone means looking them in the eyes, past one&#8217;s own anger and seeing their hurt. Loving someone means recognising a problem and having the courage to fix it and welcome change. Calculation in a relationship does not mean putting on airs or feigning interest where there is none. Calculation means being deliberate in your words and actions whilst considering the proper intentions for each one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these points in mind, here is a list of questions you and your partner can use to assess where you are in your relationship and then work towards building a better understanding of each other and more meaningful habits. Be honest. Do not use the list as a way to exonerate yourself of all fault or seek fault in your partner. A loving relationship means you are reading this because you want to make things work and care about your partner; indeed, you want to love them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the authority of Abu Hamzah Anas bin Malik (RA) &#8211; the servant of the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said :&#8221;None of you will believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.&#8221;<em> (Bukhari)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write your answers down and assess your own responses. The results should be self-explanatory. There is no grade or written assessment. Let’s Begin:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you find that you become easily angered when speaking to or dealing with your partner?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Do you respect your partner&#8217;s opinions or suggestions or even allow room for their suggestions and opinions at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. When arguing, do you resort to an &#8220;I don&#8217;t care anymore&#8221; frame of mind?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. If your partner cries in front of you, does it soften you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. When your partner cries in front of you, do you find yourself feeling detached?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. When you apologise is it said with sincerity or with spite?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Are your apologies followed by quantifiers; e.g., “I&#8217;m sorry, but…” whilst <i>your</i> point of contention is repeated?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Is your intimacy self-focused or do you make efforts to fulfil your partner&#8217;s needs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Do you try to honour and fulfil requests made by your partner that impact the health of your relationship e.g., please stop smoking, please lose weight, please wear your hijab, please earn halal income?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Would your partner describe your relationship as, “It&#8217;s their world, I simply live in it”?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. In general, when sitting alone with your partner, do you find conversation comes easily or do you sit in silence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12.When you find yourself admiring your partner or some quality of theirs, do you communicate it or keep it to yourself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. If you find that your partner is sad a lot of the time or only every-now-and-again do you try to find out why (with the intention being one of love and concern) or does it irk you? i.e., <i>Ugh, what now</i>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14. Would you describe your relationship as a friendship and a team or a convenient business contract?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15. What do you want the most out of your relationship? Be honest. And when the opportunity allows, share your answer with your partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #c4006c;"><strong>And they say, &#8220;Our Lord, let our spouses and children be a source of joy for us, and keep us in the forefront of the righteous.&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Furqan :74)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #c4006c;">&#8220;Our Lord, and admit them into the gardens of Eden that You promised for them and for the righteous among their parents, spouses, and children. You are the Almighty, Most Wise.”</span> </strong>(Ghafir :8)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #c4006c;">“Among His proofs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves, in order to have tranquility and contentment with each other, and He placed in your hearts love and care towards your spouses. In this, there are sufficient proofs for people who think.”</span> </strong>(Ar-Room :21)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in complicated times. Our lives are not as simplistic as perhaps our own parents’ may have. Yet, simple doesn’t always mean easier. Indeed, our parents lived simpler lives but may have endured more hardships than we. At the same time, we live relatively easy lives, facilitated by so many modern comforts, yet despite this era of relative ease, everything about our modern existence is extremely complex. Within the context of this Brave New World, the dynamics of society have undergone a multitude of paradigm shifts, affecting every aspect of our human interaction. It goes without saying; the Muslim community has not been exempt. A lot of the “simplicity” that may have once distinguished the Muslim household from other faiths and society in general has now been swept along a fast-moving current, largely due to the ubiquity of social media and smart gadgets. In a world of instant messaging and instant responses, video sharing and popular culture, relationships in general are struggling to keep up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With so much competing for our time, we wind up numb and oddly desensitized when we are forced to slow down. Hence, couples are losing things to say to one another with silence pervading most close encounters, leaving no choice but to return to the comfortable distraction of a smart device. The problems that further extend from what is then projected onto our psyche from within social media add a whole other layer of complexity. We have come to develop fanciful expectations of our spouses that each cannot possibly live up to. Of course there are an abundance of other challenges facing Muslim couples today that do not stem solely from the technological era we live in, but it is without doubt the hallmark of the times in which we are living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Muslim family to survive these challenges, we must default to what is at the heart of our beliefs through, not only, <i>patience, prayer and perseverance</i>, but a real and true understanding of what it means to “complete the other half of the religion.” In essence, we are recognising marriage as an act of <i>worship </i>that has been made compulsory upon every able man and woman, to be performed to the best of one’s ability and seeking of Allah’s reward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every Muslim family is facing some sort of battle. There is hardly a family that can contest this reality. But it is our duty to rise above and distinguish ourselves as we once did, as our Muslim ancestors and the Companions did. As husbands and wives it is incumbent that we check our intentions with regards to those in whom Allah (SWT) has made us responsible and make our actions deliberate and meaningful, knowing that we are accountable before Allah (SWT). Sometimes, we lose focus and get caught up in this so-called “human experience”, which is really a euphemism for giving in to one’s whims and desires. Strength of character is not in dominating others and seeing your will exacted, rather it is overcoming the whisperings of Shaytaan and choosing peace for the sake of Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c4006c;"><b>“I guarantee a house in Jannah (Paradise) for one who gives up arguing, even if he is in the right; and I guarantee a house in the middle of Jannah for one who abandons lying even when joking / for the sake of fun; and I guarantee a house in the highest part of Jannah for one who has good manners.”</b></span> <em>Prophet Muhammad (SAW), (Abu Dawud)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is by no means easy and does take practice. No one is perfect and Allah Who created us is best in knowledge of that. It does not mean that you suffer in silence or that the Muslim should be relegated to a loveless and unfulfilling marriage. We should all constantly assess and reassess our relationships: with our spouses, with our families, with our children and indeed with Allah. That is the closest to truthfulness and uprightness. Allah is Just and loves those who are just. So if you and your spouse find that you are at a stalemate, take the time to quietly and thoughtfully assess which elements are missing from your relationship. Do it regularly; at least twice a year. Be honest about what you need to feel loved or validated and do it with the intention of pleasing Allah as well as endearing your spouse to you, and out of Allah’s abundant Mercy and with His permission, He will make your affairs blessed.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Sa’diyya Nesar shares her experience as a newly married person with disability.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never thought that marriage was an option for me due to living life with a physical ‘disability,’ however, I unexpectedly faced a proposal despite my external circumstance. The questions and worries brought up from my parents and myself were answered up to a standard where the only thing left for us was to accept. We were on route to accept the possibility of me getting married despite having a disability!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The road to acceptance with regards to marriage did not stop with just accepting the proposal. It was only after marriage that I realised that there was more to accept about being in a marriage with a disability, not only from me, but from my spouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #d9629d;"> <b>Acceptance of the other</b></span><br />
To marry someone who has any form of disability requires you to accept their conditions for better or for worse. Any proposal that is considered needs thorough assessment, however, even more thorough assessment needs to be made if one is faced with a disability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The disability needs to be the focus in order to better decide and plan with regards to how to adapt to the new way of life for both parties. They need to assess whether the spouse could financially manage to look after the other who has the disability and whether the new change in caretaker could be easily adapted to by the one that is facing health challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This therefore leads to not only the acceptance towards the one who has the disability but rather the acceptance of the spouse that does not have a disability. Would I be comfortable receiving physical aid from my spouse?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not easy for one that has a disability to accept help from others &#8211; having a new caretaker in the form of a spouse is a huge adjustment. At times I have had others help me but I would never totally feel at ease compared to having my parents help me. The help from others would cause me to feel grateful, however, gratitude would be associated with guilt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt the constant need to give back and owe someone for their kindness, that I could not accept help from others in totality, even if it was from my closest friends. Marriage, for me, was always out of the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marriage with one spouse having a disability, therefore, does not necessarily mean that the sole acceptance is from one that does not have health challenges. The struggle for acceptance goes both ways, where there are separate challenges, as to why the decision needs to be carefully assessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d9629d;"><b>Acceptance of the self</b></span><br />
I previously thought that marriage only required the acceptance of each other—my spouse accepting my disability and me accepting him as my caretaker &#8211; however with time I realised that there was more to accept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first week of marriage caused me to face how there were some parts of my disability that I did not fully accept even though I thought that I did. I would try to be a dutiful wife by attempting to cook with my mother, and even try to do things on my own, but at times I would find it physically challenging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I previously would accept my limitations, but after marriage I tried to push myself into trying, and spiraled down whenever I could not manage. I would push myself to the extent of exhaustion, so much so that at times I had to be stopped by my spouse, who reminded me how he accepted me and my limitations. He wanted me to learn to accept them too, and not feel bad if I couldn&#8217;t manage. Not being able to manage does not make me less of a wife, as he does not expect anything more from me, besides what I am able to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband’s reassurance would help for a while, but I would later catch myself trying again, until I was firmly stopped. I was made to assess why I kept pushing myself, especially when whatever I was trying to do was not expected from me. I realised, after introspecting, that I had a self-perceived notion and fear of not being able to be a “good” wife. How not being able to do something on my own made me feel less dutiful as a wife. This attitude caused me to not accept my limitations, I wanted to be someone I was not for my husband and future children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not face this challenge prior to marriage because I did not feel any responsibility towards anyone. I was only dutiful towards myself and therefore accepted myself with no expectations. I needed to accept that my spouse accepted me for me, because by doing so, I would only then be able to accept myself in totality &#8211; an individual that was now married in spite of having physical disabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband taught me that we should set our own standards within marriage, where there are no concrete norms of how marriage should be like. He encouraged me instead to focus on obeying Allah (SWT), try my best, and also accept the circumstances that Allah (SWT) put me in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #d9629d;"><b>Acceptance of Allah (swt)’s decree</b></span><br />
Marriage with a disability therefore does not only require the acceptance of the other, or self, but rather also Allah (swt)’s decree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To acknowledge that it was Allah (swt)’s will for one to get married in spite of having a disability. To not deny, or complain, but rather wholeheartedly accept with the focus being on Allah (swt). The shift in focus would give ease in accepting my circumstance. I feel content in whatever I have or do not have &#8211; or in my case &#8211; whatever I can do and cannot do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I could not see how my life with physical disabilities could result in me being a good wife, however, my life with physical disabilities has pushed me to grow and has also allowed my husband to be the best husband that he can be in order to compensate for my needs. Our test has allowed us to taste the blessings of marriage on another level where we have not only grown in accepting ourselves or each other but also Allah’s (SWT) plans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marriage has therefore been a means to go down the road of acceptance, where I not only got to accept my spouse as my caretaker, but also further accept myself whilst living life with a disability. I have been able to experience what it is like to be wholeheartedly accepted even when my health was at its worst. I also got to accept the test that Allah (SWT) has given me and can feel His blessings pouring through. I have learned to remain steadfast, despite life’s twists and turns, and to know that this road of acceptance taken after marriage will ultimately lead my spouse and I to a place where we all hope to be accepted &#8211; Paradise.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[SISTERS Marriage coach, Megan Wyatt, suggests taking time out to evaluate the growth in your marriage. One sister asks how she can]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day I got married to my husband was a major turning point in my life, and I can safely say it was the same for him. Not because it was marriage, but because of what our decision to marry each other represented to each of us. It was who we were that brought us together, but remaining as those same individuals would not be enough to keep us happily together. I am the first to admit to the world that marriage isn’t easy. I must embrace the growth and development it brings forth in who I am becoming as each day passes. We both aim every day to give our relationship the spotlight it not only deserves, but requires. On some days, things go as planned, and on others, many others, one or both of us fall short. Because we refuse to give up and allow the comfort of mediocrity to set in, whatever is swept under the rug is exposed pretty quickly. Dealing with that ‘dust’ isn’t always pleasant, but like a clean house, it gives us a fresh operating base for our love. Take some time out just to admire how far you’ve grown as a couple, or if the reality is to see how far you’ve grown apart, it’s an opportunity to have a heart to heart and recommit to each other once again, make the conscious intention in your heart to work towards the kind of relationship you once had and believe is possible again, insha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b80647;"><em><strong>How can I show my emotions in a way that does not scare or bore my husband, where he actually listens to my concerns and issues and takes me seriously?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Before I tackle your question, I would like to draw some attention to several beliefs you have expressed regarding the way your husband receives your concerns and the way you express emotions. The assumption, as you have put it, is that he is either scared of your emotions or bored by them, and that he doesn’t take you seriously when you bring up something you are concerned about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it one hundred percent true that he is always scared of your emotions? How do you know that it’s true that he is scared of them? What signs are present in his body that express fear? The alternative then is that is he isn’t scared, but bored? Those are quite different aren’t they? Perhaps he is neither scared nor bored of your emotions, but in reality you express yourself in a way that is truly overwhelming for him personally. How? When we show strong emotion, and a man doesn’t see a window ‘in’ to bring a solution, one coping mechanism is to shut down. I’m thinking blank stares, yawns and stretching, little emotional feedback or input on your comments. It may simply be one of those ‘Mars and Venus’ moments that John Gray is most noted for writing about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since your question provided such little detail, I am naturally left with many scenarios in my head. I usually assume, unless otherwise stated, that you have married a really nice, decent Muslim man, and if that is the case, I know that he cares about your emotions and what you are feeling and going through; working on your delivery may be the only change that has to be made. The most essential rule is to avoid the blame game. What is really wrong beneath the surface doesn’t get expressed, and frustrated accusations come out instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you take the opportunity to ask him what happens when you express emotions or concerns, and ask if there is a better way for you to share what’s going on in a way that is respectful to him. You may be surprised at the insight he offers, if you are willing to listen without being defensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b80647;"><em><strong>How do I convince my husband to let me visit my mum every 2 weeks or so? He doesn&#8217;t have a problem with her coming over, but he doesn&#8217;t want me to visit her/spend the night at her place. This really hurts me and I find it difficult to have to choose between my husband and my mum.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it’s wonderful that you have such a close relationship with your mother, and continue to maintain that relationship with her, masha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I have to say I am in agreement with your husband regarding you staying the night with your mother, without him, every few weeks. You are a married woman now, and your natural desire should be to have your husband near you, and for him to desire you being near to him. If visiting her means every other weekend you are gone, having to stay the night due to distance, then I can understand his frustration. That’s a lot of time you two aren’t spending together doing things that are fun and relaxing. You shouldn’t have to choose between your mother and your husband, and he also shouldn’t have to choose between having his wife nearby, or being alone without her several times a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can visit her without staying the night, and you can go down and back in a day, then every few weeks may be fine, but your husband should be coming along too. You can enjoy the drive together, have a nice meal with the family, and maybe even help out your mother with things around the house that your husband is more capable of doing. I understand you may want time alone with your mother, but you can also call her during the week, and even use skype video to speak with her. Today there really aren’t any barriers to communication on a personalised and consistent basis. If your mother doesn’t have that kind of technology, get it for her!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we get married, our relationships with our family of origin are going to go through some changes, and while there is never a need to stop being emotionally close to your parents, or visiting them, there is a need to become even closer to your husband. He is your primary relationship now, and I sense that there is some work to be done beneath the surface in order for you to desire his presence at a greater level. You are welcome to send a follow up question for further clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> There are some husbands who seek to control who their wife can speak with, limiting family interaction, friends, and community as a way of isolating her from those she trusts and those who love her. This comes in the guise of forbidding the visiting or talking to family, monitoring all conversations, and reading through emails or text messages. If you find you are being isolated from those who have been in your life for many years, then I encourage you to seek professional support to see what to do in such a situation. Islamically, no one should ever desire to see you cut off from the people you love and who love you, who raised you and cared for you in your life. A husband’s role is to support you in your relationships, not reduce them.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Alizeh Khan explains how to make some safe, easy and gentle products for the family and, at the same time, reduce our environmenta]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The environment and the earth are resources provided to us by Allah (SWT) as a means of sustenance, provision and shelter. Individuals are the gatekeepers and vessels to maintain the land with the knowledge and mercy of Allah (SWT). It is important as Muslims to be aware of our ecological footprint and refrain from wasting resources. Making small differences in the waste we accumulate can reduce our environmental impact and create a more sustainable future for our families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you may ask what small steps you can take to make yours and your children’s daily lifestyle more eco-friendly. There are a variety of ways to turn your everyday household items into greener alternatives for your kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Natural, Cleansing, Light Shampoo</strong></span><br />
Finally, a non-traditional means to clean children’s hair! For most children, you need something that’s easy on the eyes and fun for bath-time routines. This is a simple recipe to create a gentle shampoo that is cost-effective when the ingredients are bought in bulk and fun to make with the kids, as it requires just a little shaking. It also replenishes the hair with essential nutrients for a healthy look!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Ingredients:</em></span><br />
• ¼ cup coconut milk (homemade will be better if your child’s hair is non-oily/dry)<br />
• 1⁄3 cup liquid soap (Castille soap)<br />
• ½ tsp olive oil (or almond oil)<br />
• Optional: ½ tsp Vitamin E oil (for shininess)<br />
• Optional: 15-20 drops of essential oils (combination of lavender and rosemary or preferred combinations that smell good for the kids)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Method:</em></span><br />
1. Combine ingredients in a container (or old shampoo bottle).<br />
2. Shake well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Note:</em> This recipe lasts for a month and, before each use, shake well. Also, make sure to use just a teaspoon-sized amount for each application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"> </span><br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"> <strong>Cloth Baby Wipes</strong></span><br />
Using water to clean your baby is the best way to go about saving on baby wipes and reduce the waste we accumulate. However, a neat and recyclable way to clean up after your baby is to make your own baby wipes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Items Needed:</em></span><br />
• Cut up flannel pieces or wash cloths<br />
• 1 cup water<br />
• 1 tbsp baby wash, shampoo or soap shavings<br />
• ½ tbsp baby oil or olive oil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Method:</em></span><br />
1. Mix all the liquid ingredients together in container.<br />
2. Put cloths in a large mixing bowl and pour liquid over the cloths.<br />
3. Let them sit on one side for at least 10 minutes and then turn the cloths over and let their other sides sit for 10 minutes.<br />
4. Store these cloths in a large plastic bag or plastic container.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> These cloths can be hand washed and reused, cutting down on the use of harmful substances often found in store-bought wipes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Eco-Friendly Bubble Bath Mixture</strong></span><br />
A fun recipe for the kids and completely natural! It cuts costs and is a natural means to make a whole lot of bubbles and make bath time fun. Have the kids make it with you and it’s like whisking batter &#8211; the kids will love it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Recipe:</em></span><br />
• 1 cup soap/shampoo (organic preferred)<br />
• ¾ cup water<br />
• ½ to 1 tsp glycerin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em>Method:</em></span><br />
1. Mix ingredients together with a whisk.<br />
2. Run water and add a little mixture (or a lot) to cause frothy foamy bubbles to form in the bathtub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Glycerin can easily be found at your local health or pharmacy store. Also, shampoo can be used when in dire need to create bubbles &#8211; this recipe can be stored for future use and a little goes a long way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to note that if irritation or discomfort arises, use more familiar products. These sort of recipes are a great way to make inexpensive products that reduce chemical excess and waste and come from natural sources. Educate yourselves about the manufacturing processes of products and try to use organic products to reduce the environmental impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explore different recipes and combinations of ingredients that best suit your family and lifestyle and, most of all, have fun!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">&#8220;O children of Adam! &#8230; eat and drink: but waste not by excess, for Allah loves not the wasters.&#8221;</span> </strong><span style="color: #999999;">(Al-A&#8217;raf:31)</span></em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[LaYinka Sanni talks to three widows about their relationships with their in-laws after their husbands had passed away.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘What would happen if he died?’ I mused, as the topic we least like to think about became one I had to confront upon the passing of a dear friend’s spouse. Death is a known reality that we like to keep at a distance, but it hit me at full-speed, leaving me lamenting about what would become of me and my family if my husband was to be beckoned back to our Lord before me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was less about the heart-tugging sorrow of losing a loved one, but more a lucid string of thoughts about the more practical aspects: What would happen to the kids? Would I be able to cope? What would I do with all his stuff? Would I ever marry again? &#8211; of course not, my mind screamed &#8211; and what would things be like with my in-laws?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The in-laws. We talk so much about in-laws prior to marriage &#8211; how to maintain a zen-like balance and stay in the mother hen’s good books &#8211; but there’s little mention of family dynamics if our husband was to leave us and his parents behind on the next leg of his journey. And so I set out on a quest to find out what life with in-laws is like after the death of their son, and I was equally surprised and comforted by the stories Maryam, Sara, and Dr Kemi* shared with me. Each of their situations differed greatly, thus the aftermath of their husbands&#8217; passing was unique. While Sara was a carer to her father-in-law, Maryam and her in-laws lived on opposite sides of the city, and Dr Kemi resided miles from her in-laws, so also didn&#8217;t have daily contact with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #64b7cc;"><strong>Family dynamics</strong></span><br />
My initial surprise stemmed from the beauty in the dynamic of Maryam’s relationship with her in-laws; with so many in-law horror stories floating around, it was refreshing to gain insight into the other side. “My husband was very close to his sister and parents,” Maryam told me. “Often you hear people complain about their in-laws, but I always thought I am so lucky to have a really amazing set of in-laws. They were so kind to me, accepting of me and very welcoming. They took me immediately under their wing, and I always felt at home whenever I was visiting.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sara, on the other hand, had a rather lonely experience. With no mother-in-law around, and an ailing father-in-law to care for, looking after her husband in the run-up to his passing was not easy. “My husband was the only son and had a sister a year older than him,” she told me. “His mother died 10 years earlier, and his very elderly father lives next door to us. My husband and I shared his care. His sister did not assist at all. During my husband&#8217;s illness, I looked after my father-in-law for the last two years as an unpaid carer. Now my husband has passed, I look after him on my own with no support from his own family, not even his daughter.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Kemi’s other half came from a large family whom he was close to, which has its benefits as well as its trials. “I have a cordial relationship with his family,” she said, “but you know, as an African family, some people were not happy since I was his only wife and they felt that with his status, he should have had more than one wife.” Negative dispositions within families can often be masked under normal circumstances, but they easily come to the fore at tender times such as the period of grief, as a loved one’s loss leaves a void that many so desperately want to fill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sara saw the truth of this more than she would have cared for. “My sister-in-law has stopped talking to me since seeing my husband&#8217;s will. This was very distressing and upsetting for me. This happened very early on, and I find it very stressful as she was my husband&#8217;s sister, especially as she wishes to maintain contact with my three young children, but wants to cut me out of the picture.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #64b7cc;"><strong>Laying to rest</strong></span><br />
How often do we consider how we’d like to be laid to rest? It’s so easy to take for granted the fact that Islam has rites and rituals to be followed when we pass away, but what about those of us who have non-Muslim relatives, who we know would love to send us off in a way that helps their healing? Despite the wonderful connection Maryam shared with her in-laws that aided her grieving &#8211; as they were able to grieve their lost love as a solid family unit &#8211; the issue of her husband’s burial became a point of contention that completely threw her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is the part where things got interesting and challenging. His parents became a united front, and for the first time since I knew them, I felt like anything I wanted for my deceased husband as a Muslim was fast being overlooked by the arrangements being made by the non-Muslim family.” In many respects, this is understandable as he was their child, after all. They had raised him, and the truth of this wasn’t lost on Maryam, although it was difficult to contend with. “I felt I had lost all control of the situation as his side of the family had made arrangements, and I had to just go with it. I completely respected the fact that this was their son, and their claim to him was not to be overlooked.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Maryam felt at a loss and was stunned to silence, but the tides turned and his family came round to respecting her wishes, which were ultimately an extension of her husband’s. “What happened was that his side of the family beautifully agreed to my husband&#8217;s body to be collected from the hospital, the washing of his body ritual to take place, to shroud him in his kaffan, for his funeral prayer to be prayed at the mosque he held close to his heart and to be buried with the imam and all present to make the Qur’an and Sunnah part of the entire event. It was such a turn of events that the women of his family turned up at the mosque wearing ‘abayahs and headscarves.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Maryam finally got what she’d silently prayed for, Dr Kemi had her hands tied and was unable to have a say in the arrangements of her husband’s funeral. “He died in a plane crash, so it was the federal government that arranged it. Though the families wanted individual burials, it was denied and a national burial was organised, with the Muslims among them buried according to Islamic law.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #64b7cc;"><strong>Widow-to-widow </strong></span><br />
Becoming a widow is never at the forefront of our minds despite the knowledge that spouses are but a loan to us from Allah (SWT), and that they &#8211; as well as we &#8211; will eventually return to Him. The three widows I had the opportunity to interview had differing experiences not only in their in-law interactions during the wake of the death of their husbands, but also in how they all dealt with the pain of such an insurmountable loss. Their tests gave them an opportunity to grow, and they have an insight into a domain of life that many of us are oblivious to. These are their gems of wisdom:<br />
Sara says, “I&#8217;d say the greatest challenge is to ‘expect abandonment’ as this happens. Be it mother-in-law, father-in-law, sisters-in-law, or brothers-in-law etc., especially regarding the will. They may not like the fact they haven&#8217;t been left with much. Despite your spouse making his will, they may take it out on you. Be prepared.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Dr Kemi shared the same sentiment, “The greatest challenges have to do with the sharing of assets, as in-laws always care about the assets more than the welfare of the children or the immediate family the man leaves behind.” Although this was a potential roadblock for her, Dr Kemi still became triumphant, and her heart was put at ease. “The greatest triumph with my in-laws came when I decided to follow exactly how the Qur’an said things should be shared. I took all the assets to a shari’ah court for it to be shared, and accepted all what was given to me and my kids in good faith and prayed for Allah (SWT) to bless it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid the stresses surrounding inheritance, Sara advises that, “If your husband is sick, prepare a will and gift anything prior. Protect yourself, if possible. Try to maintain ties of kinship but if they don&#8217;t reciprocate, let go for your own sanity. There is enough to deal with in terms of ‘ibadah, bills and adjustment, so try to keep away anything negative that will bring you down further at a time when you have hit rock bottom.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Kemi reminds widows to, “Hold on to Allah (SWT), and hold on to the Qur’an and Sunnah. Fasting and prayers are what brought me to this point.” And with regards to widows with children, she stresses that widows, “Teach the children to work hard and get their own [wealth] by studying hard and achieving success.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a widow navigates the crest and fall of the emotions and immediate responsibility left on her shoulders when bereavement strikes, there is so much wisdom in the pertinent parting words from Sara:<br />
“Please remember this is not a punishment but a test from Allah (SWT), as Allah (SWT) tests those He loves. For months I thought it was a punishment, but now realise it wasn&#8217;t. We are all going one day and Allah (SWT) deemed the time for our spouse to go as the best time for him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, love lost is love gained, and Maryam reminds us that in the melee of the days and months after losing one&#8217;s spouse, we should remember everyone, including the in-laws, is hurting. &#8220;Communication is key; balance this with giving each other enough space to deal with the loss. Maintain good ties and rely on each other as much as you can for support.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Raidah Shah Idil interviews Sara, Ali and Tamara about the effects of bipolar disorder on their marriages.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bipolar. For some people, few words muster up as much emotion. Books and movies like “The Silver Linings Playbook” show the challenges faced by people with bipolar disporder and the people who love them. According to the Black Dog Institute, &#8220;Bipolar disorder is the name used to describe a set of &#8216;mood swing&#8217; conditions, the most severe form of which used to be called &#8216;manic depression&#8217;.&#8221; Bipolar I is the more severe form, where individuals are predisposed towards mania, have longer episodes of mania, and are more likely to have psychotic experiences which may lead to hospitalisation. Bipolar II occurs in individuals with a less severe form of mania referred to as hypomania, but without the psychotic element.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve interviewed a writer with Bipolar Type 1, Sara (pen name) and her husband, Ali (pen name), who is not bipolar. I’ve also interviewed Tamara Redfern, Sara’s life coach, who also is bipolar. Tamara has been married for almost eighteen years and is a mother of two. I’d like to thank all of them for their honesty and courage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #bd0000;"> <em><strong>1. What is it like to be married to someone who is bipolar?</strong></em></span><br />
Sara: I’m so glad the first year is over! I used to take my husband’s negative emotions so personally when it had nothing to do with me. I’m getting better at managing my moods, and Ali has been really grounding. I’ve helped him open up and talk about his emotions, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ali: The beginning of our marriage was fun yet difficult. It took me a while to get used to a person who needed a lot of care &#8211; be it therapy, life coaching, or a good GP. The first six months were the hardest as I was still recognising patterns and triggers and also understanding what were the appropriate responses. It eventually got easier, especially once I learnt the tell-tale signs. I think I&#8217;m slowly getting better at working together with my wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara: Being married and having bipolar (disorder) are both challenges and blessings in their own right. They both have strengthened me in knowledge and understanding of myself and my faith. Throughout the highs and the lows of each, I realise that all I really have is Allah. He is whom I cry to when I’m down and out with nowhere to turn in my marriage or in my journey with bipolar (disorder), and when I’m feeling like I’m on top of the world. It is His blessing that I am married to an understanding and supportive man who accepts me and doesn’t look at my bipolar (disorder) as a flaw. It’s just a part of what makes me Tamara. Masha Allah, it’s a major blessing to have someone like that in your life. He’s not like a parent or a sibling who loves you yet doesn’t have to deal with you every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bd0000;"><strong><em>2. What fears did you have concerning having bipolar disorder, and being married?</em></strong></span><br />
Sara: I’m afraid of having a manic episode and hurting my husband and children, but I don’t even have any kids yet! To prepare for motherhood, I’m weaning off my medication under the supervision of my psychiatrist. So far, so good. When my fears start getting out of hand, I reach out to my loved ones, life coach, or therapist. Ultimately, giving everything back to Allah is the lasting remedy for all of my worries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ali: My earliest fears were any exaggerated responses to a situation. She was once upset and said that she wanted a hammer so she could smash things. My immediate response was to hide the hammer and all similar tools. Months later, when she was calmer, I told her what I did and she laughed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara: I worry that I may forget who I am and not remember certain aspects of my life. I’m always fearful that maybe during an episode I might do something that is totally uncharacteristic and embarrass my family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bd0000;"><strong><em>3. How did you and your spouse work together to manage your moods?</em></strong></span><br />
Sara: Before marriage my family was the second line of defence, and I was the first. Now, I’m still the first line of defence, and my husband is the second. He’s mastered the art of gently yet firmly letting me know when I need to look after myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ali: We talked through a lot of her different ups and downs and learned to deal with it. I learned things like during cold weather she needed warming comfort food. I gradually developed a list of ways to manage her moods that included telling her to take a nap, specific foods, giving her alone time, or reaching out to family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara: My husband and I work together to manage my moods by being vigilant on the fluctuations and by paying attention to my triggers and cycles. The main key is knowing yourself and your mood cycle because you are your first line of defence. Your husband is there and he&#8217;s your backup, but he is not able to watch your every mood and to notice all the details of what&#8217;s going on in your life on a day-to-day basis. Be honest with each other. If you are not feeling well, let him know ASAP. Accept his advice on any behaviour modifications and know that it’s coming from a place of love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bd0000;"><em><strong>4. What kind of stigma did you face, and how have you overcome that?</strong></em></span><br />
Sara: On the one hand, bipolar is seen as ‘sexy,’ but when it comes to issues like’ bipolar rage’ it’s scary. There’s also a cultural stigma surrounding mental illness, which prevents a lot of people from getting the right type of help. Because of that, most members of both our extended families have no idea that I have bipolar (disorder). Sometimes I feel that’s safer so they won’t jump to incorrect conclusions or go into denial. Other times, I feel like it’s not something to be ashamed of. Bipolar (disorder) has a large genetic component, so part of me feels like the rest of my cousins should know in case their children develop symptoms. The first two years of my mood swings were terrible because I had no idea what was happening to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ali: I&#8217;m still overcoming this. My extended family have no idea she has bipolar (disorder).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara: I&#8217;d have to say that the only stigma I really face has been self-imposed. For the first 15 years of my bipolar journey I tried to hide it from my children. Like many women, my onset was post-partum, so I never wanted them to feel that something was wrong with them or that they caused me to become sick. Once they became teenagers and I could no longer hide the mood swings and I had a manic episode, we had a long discussion in my recovery. Now they understand a part of who I am and actually try to help avoid my triggers. Masha Allah they really understand way more than I gave them credit for!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bd0000;"><strong><em>5. What advice do you have for any couple going through the bipolar journey?</em></strong></span><br />
Sara: Be patient with each other. Often the spouse with bipolar (disorder) tends to be harder on him/herself when both spouses are equally important halves of the marriage. Remember to do fun things together! Most of all, keep turning to Allah. He gave bipolar (disorder) to me out of His wisdom, and it’s taught me a lot, including how to be kinder to myself and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ali: You need to connect your state with a higher purpose and know that Allah Ta&#8217;ala has placed you in this state for a reason. Use this to find closeness to Allah and to turn to Him for support. For me, being married to someone with bipolar (disorder) is my means to success in the next world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara: The best advice I can give to anyone who&#8217;s going through the bipolar journey is to consistently and constantly rely upon Allah. Bipolar (disorder) is a test just like anything else is a test in this life and only He can make it easier for you and relieve you as you&#8217;re going through it. I&#8217;m rarely praying for Allah to remove bipolar (disorder) from me; I just pray that I&#8217;m able to understand what it is that He wants for me and what bipolar (disorder) has to teach me.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Umm Suhayb likes to prise her munchkins’ hands away from those keyboards and get them into the dough. Here, she brings you some ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s one thing that’s almost certain to lift those young eyes from their iPods, TV screens or computer monitors: food. Whether you’re babysitting some nieces and nephews, or it’s pouring with rain outside, cooking is always an engaging activity. So when the echoes of “I’m bored” get too much, tempt them into the kitchen with promises of (limited) mess-making, spatula-licking, and wholesome goodness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ad0000;"><strong>Getting started</strong></span><br />
If possible, choose a time when you are in good spirits and have a reserve of sabr; this is not going to be pretty. Mornings are often better, but there can be something about that late evening bake when the kids are restless during the school holiday evenings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think how many children your kitchen can comfortably accommodate, and ensure that the tasks involved can be delegated more or less equally to avoid those “It’s my turn to stir/ pour in the flour” moans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about appropriate clothing, be it aprons or an old shirt, as I am yet to find an ingredient that is not messy (OK, maybe water). For minimal stress, do it when the floor is due for a clean anyway, so that you don’t have to mop it twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have all the ingredients, pots, pans and utensils to hand. Nothing is more disappointing than finding you have run out of baking powder which then cancels any fluffy cake making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure everyone washes their hands. This is always a good habit, as young fingers host more types of germs than the Olympics do athletes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ad0000;"><strong>Bismillah!</strong></span><br />
It is always good to start things with ‘Bismillah’ and cooking is no different. I find a disastrous oven episode often follows the omission of these words. So why not increase the barakah in the food by starting off right? Don’t forget to say it again when you all tuck into the resulting culinary masterpieces!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ad0000;"><strong>A simple sandwich</strong></span><br />
For the younger ones, making a simple sandwich can be a fun challenge, and can be a practical lesson for the future. Let them spread the butter, choose the fillings and decide whether to cut it into squares, rectangles or triangles. In fact, you can use cookie cutters to make the sandwich shape more interesting (use the remaining crusts for feeding the ducks or to make breadcrumbs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe a Dad is reading this (we know you do!) and could assist their son or daughter to make a heart-shaped piece of toast with honey for Mama for breakfast in bed. This would surely bring forth a smile and perhaps tears (of joy, hopefully!) to the eyes of a Mum, who is normally busying herself with breakfast for all the family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ad0000;"><strong>Fun fruit salad</strong></span><br />
My son’s favourite is making a fruit salad. Even quite young children can cut soft fruit such as bananas with a blunt knife, and the older ones can do it all themselves. Grapes, pieces of tangerines, apple slices, you name it, it can go in the fruit salad. Just top the cut fruits with some fruit juice straight away so that the fruit does not go brown. A sprinkle of cinnamon powder adds a little extra flavour. I find only older children understand what ‘sprinkle’ means, so do not delegate this to the under 5’s!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ad0000;"><strong>Perfect pizza</strong></span><br />
This is always a hit, and can be made from scratch if you have the time and patience. Or ready-made pizza bases, sauce and grated cheese plus a variety of toppings (vegetables, salami, herbs such as oregano) can just as easily be used to construct a perfect pizza.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ad0000;"><strong>Comforting cake</strong></span><br />
This is the ultimate comfort food and its creation is just as tasty. Find a simple recipe, mix the ingredients, and pop it into the oven. And then the best bit: licking the bowl. Always remember to put the oven on first so that it has a chance to heat up and so does not cause any delay in the eating of the cake by its creators. Forgetting this also means that as soon as you have added the wet ingredients to your baking powder, it starts to react. If you then have to wait too long for the oven to heat up, the cake mixture will have lost some of the gas from the baking powder reaction, and will likely be less fluffy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can buy ready-made icing tubes for some fun decoration as well as many other edible adornments for your cake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever they’ve decided to make, a fun idea is to get them to run their own ‘cafe’. They can make a menu (draw pictures if they can’t write yet), take the orders and decorate a table, perhaps with a posy of flowers from the garden. They are sure to enjoy serving you something scrumptious, and it’ll certainly make a change for the adults!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally, don’t forget to get them involved in the clean-up, although I find the thrill of washing up wanes all too quickly as they get older!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So get out the oven gloves, aprons and ingredients or just simply make some toast together. Cooking will, insha Allah, gather the family together in the kitchen. That warm, freshly-baked scent drifting around the house, and happy, well-fed children should make any mess worth it!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Khadijah L. from ADaBi, London-based publishing house, discusses the importance of finding positive role models for our children w]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color: #05615e;">Sahabah are excellent role models</span></strong><br />
Two years ago, after 20 years occupying various senior positions in the medical field, Khadija L., a mum of three, started writing religious stories for kids. The initial idea was to provide her own children with high quality books about the lives of the great Companions of Prophet Muhammad (SAW). She thought they were excellent role models for her children: they were the greatest generation and learnt Islam from the best teacher and most perfect example ever: Muhammad (SAW). They were not Prophets or Messengers, just human beings &#8211; like any one of us. They had different personalities, characters and skills. They faced many trials and yet many managed to succeed and will be among the inhabitants of Jannah. Through the lives of the Companions, she hoped that her children, and other Muslim children, could find a role model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #05615e;"><strong>Why are role models important?</strong></span><br />
Children look up to a variety of role models: parents and caregivers, siblings, friends, celebrities, books or movie characters. They are usually people they admire and wish to resemble. Through TV, tablets, mobile phones and videos games, kids are assailed by images of people presented for good or bad reasons as examples to follow. Whether we like it or not, whether their choice is obvious or not, they will take role models. The best alternative is to teach them about great figures of history, the ones who have been really successful: the ones who have earned Paradise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #05615e;">The Ten Promised Paradise</span></strong><br />
The Ten Promised Paradise were ten Companions who were promised paradise on the same occasion, during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad (SAW). They are considered the elite of the Muslim community. Among these ten Companions are the four great caliphs. Children usually know the lives of these caliphs but rarely hear about the six other Companions who were major heroes. These Companions’ lives are not taught in madrassahs. These sahabah dedicated their lives to serve Allah’s deen and support His Messenger (SAW). They were among the very first believers, when almost nobody believed in Muhammad’s message, when he was persecuted and ostracised in Makkah. Not only are they excellent role models, but they should also be honoured and remembered out of love and gratitude. They should live in the Muslims’ hearts and homes, and their lives should be taught in Islamic schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #05615e;">The ADaBi series on the Ten Promised Paradise </span></strong><br />
London based publishing house &#8216;ADaBi&#8217; are proud to announce the launch of specialist religious books on these six great Companions. Written specifically to increase knowledge and love for these sahabas, the utmost attention has been brought to all aspects of publishing &#8211; from the writing, illustrating and designing, to the choice of paper quality. The stories are based on reliable sources including the Quran, Ahadith, books about Sirah-tul-Nabi and other trustworthy Islamic history books. Attractive and beautiful illustrations have been used to capture the children’s interest and facilitate understanding. Illustrations of living beings have been avoided throughout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the lives of these Companions, children can find role models and learn Islamic morals and manners that will help them gain success in this world as well as in the Hereafter in sha Allah.</p>
