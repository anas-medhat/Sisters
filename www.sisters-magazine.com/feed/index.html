		<description><![CDATA[Sr. Aneesa from Ilmburst shares how to teach your child Islam, even if you don’t feel qualified.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Aneesa and I’m a mum of four children </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">alhamdulillah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. My husband and I have been quite focused when it comes to our children’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tarbiyyah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because we share the vision that most parents have for their children: we want our children to have a strong Islamic foundation so they are equipped to face the challenges they will inevitably face as they grow up. We want them to have sound principles from the Qur’an and Sunnah which they can use to help them navigate through their daily lives. We wanted to use these tender years to nurture their spiritual development, to get a headstart with their Qur’an memorisation, to spend quality time with them having fun and making positive memories, before they become busy and preoccupied. Our children’s guidance is in the hands of Allah, but we want to be able to say that we tried our best.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Necessity is the mother of invention&#8230;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a home educator, I came across many brilliant educational websites that contained engaging resources, which were comprehensive and everything was available in one place. There was nothing like this for Islamic education. I remember showing my husband one such website, one day, and that’s when the light bulb moment came. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both my husband and I want Muslim parents to feel confident teaching their children Islam, regardless of their background. It’s time to stop outsourcing Islamic education. It’s time to stop outsourcing our children’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tarbiyyah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s our responsibility as parents. And it’s easy! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what we want to show parents through Ilmburst. Ilmburst does the hard work for you. You just print off and use. You don’t have to have a degree in Islamic Studies, you don’t have to come from a particular background, or have a certain education, as a matter of fact, you don’t need much at all. Just a sincere desire to give your child a firm foundation and nurture in their hearts love for Allah (the Most High) and His religion. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A lifetime project is born</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting Ilmburst together was an intense, but incredibly rewarding journey, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">alhamdulillah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband did the bulk of the work, the meetings with the web developers, and the resources that required research and access to Arabic books. For three months, he worked day and night. I worked on creating resources that required a bit more creativity. Before launch, we spent a couple of nights awake, manually uploading 2000 resources onto the server.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a really exciting time. We were both buzzing! The brainstorming parts were mind blowing as we listed the topics that we wanted to cover, and how we wanted to make it engaging and fun for kids, from things like cut out jigsaws, dot to dots, colouring pages, sensory mats, worksheets on different topics, timelines, and play mats for pre-schoolers on different topics. For older children, we wanted resources with more depth and structure, so there are no gaps. We had so many ideas, and one by one, we will work through them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in sha Allah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realised it was a lifetime project. We want to keep adding to the bank of resources </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in sha Allah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, until we have comprehensively covered everything a child needs to know about their religion. It’s all about building that foundation!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A culture of learning</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment we are going through Imam an Nawawi’s 40 Hadith using the packs from Ilmburst. My ten year old takes the responsibility for reading the text in Arabic, my 7 year old reads the translation, and my five year old reads out the keywords with some assistance. My husband then goes through the key lessons from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hadith</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When explaining the lessons, we use examples of things our children can relate to or have experienced before. We then do the activity together or we sometimes do family role plays where the girls can put into practice what they’ve learned. It also shows us how much they’ve absorbed and understood. We then end with a family game of &#8211; wait for it &#8211; Blind Man’s Bluff! The whole ‘lesson’ is so simple, and requires minimal effort, but our children ask for it every week and are disappointed if we have to miss it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the information is there, the translation of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hadith</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is there; the key lessons and principles are all laid out. You can even omit the Arabic, if it’s something you’re not confident with. And everyone is capable of having a bit of fun with their children. Choose a game that you and your family enjoy. Make this whole experience part of your family culture. Your children will remember it with great fondness when they are older, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in sha Allah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it will be something they will want to do with their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Sr. Aneesa’s Words of Advice</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Small but regular</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – You don’t have to do massive projects, keep it simple. Building a foundation requires consistency. The best deeds that are the most beloved to Allah are the ones that are small and regular. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Weave Islam into their lives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – You can’t compartmentalise Islamic Studies as a subject and leave it. Sure, there is ‘theory’ to be learned, but Islam is a religion to be lived. So when things happen in your family life, take a few minutes out to talk to your children, and live the theory. When we experience blessings in our lives, we teach our children the importance of thanking Allah. When we experience hardships, we teach them about patience. When we need to make a big decision as individuals or a family, we teach them to make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">du’a</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Allah and ask for guidance. In this way, not only do we teach them important life lessons and skills but we tie in to their relationship with Allah. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sha Allah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, long after we pass from this world, they will remain strong because of their faith and will then pass this onto their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Learn and grow together</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Study together as a family; what better way is there to bond with your family and come closer to Allah! It may also be a little less overwhelming if you do it together. It’s not necessarily about us being ‘teachers’ and our children being ‘students’. We are all students when it comes to knowledge, and even if your level of Islamic knowledge is quite advanced, who doesn’t benefit from a reminder?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">May Allah (the Most High) bless us all and enable us to nurture our children in the best way possible, make our children the coolness of our eyes and make us leaders amongst the pious.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Little Maysoor is made up of a husband and wife duo who are fervently dedicated to the mission of teaching the beautiful language ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. Who is behind the Little Maysoor brand? What is your story as a family brand?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. We initially started the Little Maysoor in 2014 and we were inspired to undertake such a task due to the importance of learning the Arabic language in our religion. I embraced Islam at the tender age of 19. Three years later, I travelled to Saudi Arabia to study the deen, which included 2 years in an Arabic institute. During this time, I faced so many challenges, mainly because I began learning the Arabic language in early adulthood as opposed to as a child.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. What inspired you to start the brand?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. As parents, we did not want our children to have to face the struggles and difficulties that I personally endured trying to acquire the Arabic language, so we felt it was important that we give our children a head start by incorporating the language into their childhood so that it would be second nature for them when they got older. As time progressed, the desire to share this gift with other people&#8217;s children in the Ummah led us to begin this amazing project to try and teach the Arabic language to children all around the world.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. What was your first product and how did you go about producing it?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. Interestingly enough, our first project/product was an animated cartoon. The animation was about the importance of praying entitled, ‘Have You Prayed?’ The whole idea behind the cartoon was to teach the Arabic language and elements of the grammar in a fun and easy way by by-passing all of the rules which can oftentimes be boring and monotonous. It was at this stage that a family member suggested we make the animated videos into books &#8211; so the focus changed from animated cartoons to books. As we were in the process of writing the book, we then decided to produce plush toys which eventually arrived in the UK in 2015 in time for the Eid celebration.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. What have been your proudest moments in the business?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. We have had numerous proud moments since the inception of Little Maysoor. One of the most memorable moments was when our plush toy products actually arrived in the UK. This was because, in essence, this tangible product that we were holding in our hands initially began as an idea bouncing around in our heads. Then that idea went through numerous rigorous stages up until the final product was finally produced. This is an amazing process and, once the product is finally ready to go to market, you get a huge feeling of achievement and it was definitely a very proud moment.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Another proud moment in our business is when we actually make a sale! It goes to show that all of those doubts we had &#8211; ‘Will the product be successful or will it be a failure?’ &#8211; are alleviated as you now feel validated to some degree. It&#8217;s that feeling of joy, knowing that somebody else who doesn&#8217;t know anything about the journey, the initial concept, the difficulties that you&#8217;ve had to endure, the amount of money that you have had to spend on the product to bring it to market, sees your product and buys into the brand. It&#8217;s a tremendous feeling that has remained consistent from our very first sale in 2015 up until this very day. Every time we make a sale, it brings much joy and it&#8217;s a tremendously proud moment for the whole Little Maysoor team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lastly, another proud moment is when we receive positive feedback from our customers, whether it be a video of their child reading our books or a picture of a child holding and embracing one of our toys or simply a message from a customer explaining how our Arabic speaking toys have helped their child learn a few sentences in Arabic.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Q. What are your hopes for the future of Little Maysoor?</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. Our hopes for the future for Little Maysoor is to be the leading online teaching Arabic resource for children all around the world. We plan to have an extensive range of bilingual books for children of all ages from toddlers all the way up to early teens. We plan to have an array of animated cartoons that will be available on a subscription basis too. We would also like to increase the range of plush toys that we sell including different races, ethnic backgrounds and we would also like to really find innovative ways to connect the children of the Ummah to the Arabic language Insha&#8217;Allah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A new marriage service for reverts could be the answer to the epidemic of marital problems that converts to Islam seem to face.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speak to any revert sister for some time and you will no doubt end up asking whether she is married and if so, where her husband comes from. If she is not married, you may find yourself suggesting: “I know a good brother who is looking for a wife”. For some reason it seems that revert sisters are easy prey for a quick marriage match. There are no cultural family details to see to, no need for a large mahr, no real need for a Wali because after all, the brother will be doing her a big favour; marriage is half her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">deen </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after all. Within a short space of time the sister can be happily married!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine four years down the line and you happen to meet that same sister in the masjid with two young toddlers climbing all over her, looking worn down and tearful. She tells you that the practicing brother turned out to be controlling and verbally abusive, always putting her down and comparing her to women of his own culture. As for her in-laws, they never accepted her and her children and the ties of Muslim family kinship she had dreamt of were non-existent. Her own family were bitterly disappointed in her, and the relationship between them and their new son-in-law was always uncomfortable. As things went spiralling downhill, she had nowhere to turn. Having lost her identity, her self confidence and self esteem, she was now stuck in a marriage that she would never have chosen had she been given time to think carefully about Muslim marriage. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly this is not an unusual situation and </span><a href="https://www.solaceuk.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a charity supporting revert sisters in difficulty, finds that a large percentage of their work involves serious marital issues. It is also not unknown for Solace to receive calls from well meaning brothers, offering to support a revert sister by marrying her. They have no idea of the complexities of her situation, whether it be problems she has brought into Islam from a difficult background, or stresses she has experienced after reverting, but  they see marriage as the perfect solution to all her difficulties. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Solace in Marriage” is a new comprehensive marriage service set up by Solace. It will provide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FOUR essential services to revert sisters, and also to those wishing to marry them, in order to protect, support and nurture their futures, inshaAllah.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1) Pre-Marriage</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-marriage courses for revert sisters</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-marriage courses for men wishing to marry a revert sister</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wali Panel consisting of a panel of mature Muslim men and women that act as a ‘surrogate Muslim father’ for revert sisters – vetting the potential husband</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2) Seeking Marriage</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon successful completion of the pre-marriage course, men and reverts can search for a spouse via our carefully designed Solace Matrimonial database</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nikah service with special provision for educating non-Muslim family members and ensuring they are comfortable with the Islamic marriage process</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3) In Marriage</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First year of marriage support packages for revert sisters</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mediation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marriage counselling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Couple retreats</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4) After Marriage                                                                                      </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support for divorced revert sisters</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provisions for single mothers and their children</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remarriage guidance and support</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Solace marriage service will be a new way forward for sisters and brothers to enter, or re-enter, into a marriage which is shaped by guidance and support from the very start. It will embrace the whole family, ensuring that non-Muslim family members are helped to understand and be a part of their daughter’s future. It will aim to strengthen and develop the new family unit, build on the foundations of Islam. And for those sisters for whom re-marriage is not yet written by Allah, it will give them the confidence and strength to rebuild their lives and those of their children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASE STUDY 1: Sakina* was a new revert with a soft nature. When she was approached by a sister after the prayers one day, saying her brother needed a wife, Sakina thought it would be good to have a practising brother as her guide and support. However her parents didn’t even know she had reverted yet, as she didn’t yet feel confident to tell them. So when she explained she was going to marry a Muslim, they were shocked and upset, and refused to come to the wedding. Sakina hadn’t yet made any Muslim friends so on her wedding day she was taken to the ladies section of a mosque where some unfamiliar women were gathered. She had no idea what was happening and where her future husband was. After half an hour her sister-in-law announced that she was now married and that they were leaving. Sakina was left feeling confused and upset. Even though her marriage worked out, she still looks back to her wedding with sadness and regret that her family weren’t involved and that it hadn’t been a joyful occasion for her.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASE STUDY 2: Laila* had been looking for a husband for some time but as a single mother of three sons it was proving difficult. She eventually met a brother online who sounded understanding of her situation. Her non Muslim family disapproved and sisters warned her of the dangers of online services. She did go to her local mosque to ask the Imam if he could be her Wali but he apologised and said he was too busy. By this time she was getting to know the brother better and felt it would be fine to go ahead. They met twice and he seemed keen to marry quickly and knew a friend who was an Imam. With two other friends as witnesses, the marriage went ahead. However only three weeks after they wed, he suddenly decided the marriage wasn’t working for him and left her that weekend with nothing but a text message…Talaq, Talaq, Talaq….</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* The case studies in this article are typical of the type of situations sisters who come to Solace for support find themselves in. However, names and circumstances have been altered for confidentiality reasons.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> Tell us about yourselves</strong></p>
<p>Azara Beautique comes to you from the heart of the Middle East, offering the purest cosmetic products, created and blended with the rare and refined jewels of the Arab world. We draw our inspiration from long-standing Arab tradition of working with and not against nature. For centuries, the Arab world has sought the answer to caring for our inner and outer selves through the indepth study of native herbs and nature for daily care and medicinal use and these traditional secrets have been passed on from generation to generation and into our brand. Dr. Samira Zaidan, my mother, who is Saudi, has been a certified homeopath in both the UK and Saudi Arabia for over 20 years and I, Dr. Mona Alyedreessy, am originally a sociologist, however I have been very passionate in my mother&#8217;s work for many years and decided a few years ago to get involved with the business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to start a soap business?</strong></p>
<p>When we first started this project in my mother&#8217;s homeopathic clinic in Saudi Arabia, we noticed that a lot of people were amazed at the results of using many of the herbs, plants and resins that my mother had recommended to them to treat a variety of health problems. The idea of making soaps came from the demand of my mother&#8217;s patients for healthy and organic soaps that were free from preservatives, chemicals and fragrances and that which included the herbs, resins and plants that were suitable for their skin and scalp conditions. We found these soaps to be a success among them and we decided to create a collection of cosmetics using special herbs and resins that are known in the Arab World for their medicinal and healing properties. All of our products are 100% natural, organic, halal, chemical-free, not tested on animals, primarily vegan, handmade, sulfate/paraben free and have all been tested, approved and certified by UK labs to meet the highest of EU cosmetic safety standards.<b> </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What is the inspiration behind the brand, ingredients etc?</strong></p>
<p>I was raised since I was a child to use homeopathic medicines and natural Middle Eastern herbs to treat a wide range of health issues and they would always work. Therefore my deep trust in these herbs, oils, waters, plants and raw ingredients is what inspired me to take the business to another level and create a more professional international brand that focuses mainly on the quality and medical/health/cosmetic benefits of our ingredients. I chose to call our online &#8216;beautique&#8217; Azara, which means pure and virgin in Arabic, reflecting our use of the highest grade of ingredients and extra virgin oils, which I believe is what makes a difference to people&#8217;s skin, hair and overall wellbeing. We travelled across North Africa and The Middle East to collect all of our raw ingredients from local family businesses/farmers in the deserts and mountains. Our aim is to support small family businesses via fair-trade agreements in order to benefit as many people in this project as possible. You can find info about our journeys posted on our Instagram page!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Which is your favourite soap and why?</strong></p>
<p>Our favourite soap has to be the Fig, Olive and Zamzam soap as it was inspired by Sura 95 in The Quran and the immense health benefits that are in each ingredient. This particular soap has profound healing properties and has been a popular choice among our customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What makes the mother/daughter bond special?</strong></p>
<p>It is a beautiful thing to be able to work with family members who are as passionate as you are about your work. I have always had a very close relationship with my mother and we both have very similar personalities, which makes her very easy to work with. We do not have any official working hours between us, which is an advantage, as we sometimes stay up until 3am working on formulas and other aspects of the business, which is something you cannot do with regular employees. We are both working together to make the business a success, rather than perceiving it solely as a financial venture. It is really important for us to spread the medical knowledge of the ingredients we use so that people can benefit from the knowledge my mother has accumulated over the years. It makes us so happy to know that people have greatly benefited from using our products. It also helps to have a consultant at hand each time advice is needed and my mother is always there when I need her on board for anything. The main bonus however, is the fact our relationship has become stronger from working together alongside the ability to keep certain production secrets within the family, so it is something that I would love to pass on to my daughter one day too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>How do you divide the business tasks between yourselves?</strong></p>
<p>I handle the business side of things and my mother deals with the product side of things &#8211; so she perfects the formulas and makes sure that the products are all made in the correct way and that the information that is posted/published about the ingredients and how to use them are correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What challenges did you face when setting up the business?</strong></p>
<p>We originally tried to set up the business in Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia but it was a very long, expensive and tedious process as a British citizen. It was required of us to open a commercial factory in order to be registered as a soap business, however we did not wish to do this because we did not want to lose the novelty of the products being individually handmade and wrapped. We use very expensive ingredients in our products and it would have been too expensive to run a large scale factory, so we decided to open a company in the UK and it was a much easier and affordable process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What are your hopes for the business?</strong></p>
<p>We hope that we can one day open our own boutique store in a high-end location in London and we would love to open a few branches in The Middle East too! Our goal at the moment is reaching out to everyone who appreciates high quality natural cosmetics that are beneficial for their health &#8211; and making them easily available in department stores perhaps or other boutiques and health stores to begin with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>My mother, who has been my inspiration in everything I have done and achieved since I was a young girl.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>What are your favourite ayahs from the Qur&#8217;an?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;And when My servants ask you, [O Muhammad], concerning Me &#8211; indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided&#8221;. [2:186]</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what is beautiful. Allah loves those who do what is beautiful&#8221; [2:95]</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In light of the recent changes at SISTERS, Khadijah Stott-Andrew reflects on everything she loves about the magazine and the team ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was 13 when we headed to the conference. I had been before, and I always looked forward to the same things &#8211; the food, the semolina served at dinner, staying up late, tea and biscuits in our rooms, the stalls… the stalls were probably my favourite part. I would spend most of the year saving up my pocket money so that I would be able to spend those four glorious days purchasing books, ‘abayahs, jewellery and more books. But one thing didn’t excite me &#8211; the lectures. I found them boring. I found they didn’t apply to me; I didn’t feel that zealous excitement when the scholar spoke. When others shed tears, I checked my watch. When others hastily scrawled as many notes as possible, I wandered off to the book stalls. I was a 13 year old girl still discovering my identity. As a daughter of a revert mother and with a non-Muslim father I saw once a week, I had two different lifestyles pulling at me. I knew where I wanted to belong &#8211; Islam was the right path, Allah SWT existed and Judgement day was coming. I knew and believed all of this, but Islam and a love for the deen was far away from my heart. I wanted to belong in the Ummah &#8211; I just didn’t feel like I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, one day, the book stall had some new arrivals. I excitedly hurried over as I saw a bright magazine cover with a drawing of faceless sister in a pink hijab being embraced by a faceless brother. The pale blue letters at the top invited me over: SISTERS. The magazine was quarterly back then, and this issue was all about love; love of your family, love of your spouse and love of yourself. I was intrigued and flicked through the colourful, beautiful pages. I paid for the magazine and headed back to the lecture hall to sit beside my mum as I read through the articles. I fell in love with its friendly tone and engaging topics, but one article about the writer finding support from her younger sisters touched me the most. For the first time since my pre-teen years, I cried for something other than self-pity. I was crying from inspiration and I was crying out of love for the religion that gives so many people strength in difficult times, a religion that brought people together in a few simple pages of a magazine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read that copy of the magazine several times. Then, a few months later, I walked into our familiar Islamic bookshop, and to my absolute delight found a new issue of SISTERS by the counter. I returned to that bookshop every few months to get a new copy, always eager to read new articles and admire the breathtaking designs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I was a different person. I was married and had an almost two-year-old son running around my two-bedroom flat. I was just starting out my freelance proofreading and editing business and wanted to gather together some writers to contribute to a one-off online publication. In an ambitious and hesitant move, I contacted sister Na’ima. Not only was she the editor-in-chief of my beloved magazine, but also the author of my favourite book (interestingly, From My Sisters’ Lips had also been a guidance in my turbulent teens). Whilst asking for her contribution, and unsure if I would even get a reply, I was offered something else: a job opportunity. It was a short contract, just a couple months of copy editing, but I jumped at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was introduced to the SISTERS team and felt overjoyed! I was working behind the scenes of the very magazine that had kept my iman alive through some of the most difficult years of my life. I completed my contract with them and went on my way… only to return a month later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward a few more years and I am living in another country with my husband, and we now have three beautiful children, masha Allah. And I am still working for the magazine. Although, I don’t want to call it work. You see, the SISTERS team is more than just a temporary contract. It has become more than just a job. These sisters are my family. They are my sisters. I haven’t met them in person (except seeing the lovely Sidat sisters in Costa one year!) but they have provided me with invaluable strength and support through hard times. The casual emails and personal friendships make work a delight, not a chore. But this joy isn’t restricted to the editorial team. The writers I have worked with have blossomed into friendships across the world. One sister helped me sleep-train my toddler. Another had two children at the same time I did and we found a beautiful friendship filled with similarities and shared interests. SISTERS is truly a beautiful establishment. It holds a unique atmosphere that I am yet to discover elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishments like that do not fizzle away. SISTERS is taking a break from print issues, but that doesn’t mean ‘goodbye’. No matter which projects we pursue, editors, writers and readers of SISTERS will always be my family. You’re not getting rid of me that easily.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Papatia Feauxzar enjoys a smart and worldly new young adult Muslim title.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Written by Melati Lum | Reviewed by Papatia Feauxzar | Published by Melby Rose Publishing</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Ayesha Dean &#8211; The Istanbul Intrigue</i> is the first young adult novel written by Melati Lum. She is an Australian, Malay, Chinese, Muslim Lawyer who has worked as a Crown Prosecutor, prosecuting serious criminal offences in the courts. Melati Lum has previously worked for the United Nations in the Hague in the prosecution of war crimes that occurred in the former Yugoslavia. She currently lives in Adelaide, Australia with her family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In this book, Ayesha Dean is a fairly new eighteen-year-old high school graduate who is travelling to Turkey with her two friends, Sara and Jess, along with Sara’s father, Mr. Isa, and Ayesha’s uncle/legal guardian, Dave. Sara’s father and Dave are business partners attending a legal conference in Istanbul and they invited the girls with them on this trip. Ayesha Dean is your cool and hip Muslim chick who is knowledgeable in martial arts, dresses chic, and is a firm believer. Her courageous and detective sides also show from the first pages of this young adult book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Once in Turkey, after Ayesha, Sara, and Jess freshen up a bit, they start their tour of Istanbul at the legendary Grand Bazaar. The mystery starts after hours of buying souvenirs, trying their hand at bargaining, and combing the multitude of stalls at the bazaar where they come across of an old book shop. Looking for a present for her uncle David, Ayesha spots the perfect gift in that book bazaar: an antique book of maps. The shop owner, Mehmet, is pleasant and he introduces Ayesha to his handsome son Emre; a character I want to read more of in the future series, insha Allah. Emre shows the girls around town and while they are on a sightseeing break, Ayesha takes a closer look at her uncle’s gift and realizes that it hides a mysterious note that she decides she needs to uncover with her love and keen sense of mysteries. This leads her and her friends on a path of excitement and meetings with dangerous treasure seekers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The novel has a multitude of interesting characters and some of which make you infer that there is always more than meet the eyes with anybody, such as you have the character that judges people on appearance and you have the character whose looks make them look guilty… Overall, <i>Ayesha Dean &#8211; The Istanbul Intrigue</i> is very original and reminiscent of Nancy Drew’s series and mysteries. That said, the book also has roots in Ibn Arabi’s (The Greatest Shaykh) works. Melati Lum was able to create a very gripping Muslim fiction teen book with sound knowledge masha Allah. The teen in me really loved it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<i>Ayesha Dean &#8211; The Istanbul Intrigue</i> is not preachy at all. It has sprinkles of Arabic words that are very common knowledge these days like the word <i>hijab</i>. The plot is not religion based but about clues and crime solving. I recommend it to anyone who wants to travel to Turkey without having to buy a ticket to go there. I also recommend it to your teens readers and the children in you alike. I can’t wait to read the next tome in the series insha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Even diehard meat eaters will love this brightly coloured vegetarian meal from Clara McQuaid.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My sister’s family are all vegetarian, so when they were visiting recently I wanted to make them a unique vegetarian dish. All too often vegetarians get the rough end of the deal in restaurants, and people feel nervous about catering for them in their homes as well. This wellington was a huge success, and I recommend it for everyone, vegetarian and meat lovers alike. It’s not labour intensive, either &#8211; in fact it cuts a lot of corners but in an acceptable way, I think. The finished result is a loaf with colourful layers of delicious vegetables that looks very impressive when you slice it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #6282b5;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
• 320 gram sheet ready rolled puff pastry, or approximately 35cm x 23cm<br />
• 100 grams risotto rice<br />
• 450 ml vegetable stock<br />
• 25 grams freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br />
• 1 egg, beaten<br />
• 3 tablespoons cream<br />
• Handful fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped<br />
• Handful fresh basil, chopped<br />
• 200 grams jar roasted red peppers<br />
• 200 gram jar chargrilled aubergines<br />
• 100 grams buffalo mozzarella, drained and thinly sliced<br />
• 200 gram jar baby artichokes, or hearts, drained and sliced<br />
• 2 garlic cloves, sliced<br />
• Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />
• Dressed rocket salad to serve</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #6282b5;"> <strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Heat the oven to 200°C. Lay a sheet of puff pastry in a 22cm x 12cm non-stick loaf tin, pressing into the corners and leaving the excess hanging over the sides. Chill in the fridge while you prepare the filling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
2. Place the risotto rice in a pan and cover with the stock. Add salt to taste. Leave to cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is nearly cooked. Stir in the grated Parmesan and remove from the heat &#8211; the risotto will continue to swell and cook. Spread the risotto mixture on to a tray to prevent it from cooking any longer. Leave to cool completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Placed the rice in a bowl with the egg and cream, parsley and basil, then season to taste. Spoon half into the bottom of the pastry-lined loaf tin. Arrange a layer of the red pepper quarters on top followed by the artichokes, mozzarella cheese, garlic and aubergine slices. Cover with the remaining rice. Fold over the pastry to enclose the filling, cutting away any excess and using it to patch up where necessary. Lightly wet your fingers and seal the pastry edges to ensure the filling doesn’t seep out during cooking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Place the wellington on a baking tray and bake for 50 mins to 1 hour, until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is heated through. Leave to cool for 5 minutes in the loaf tin and turn out on to a platter to serve, or leave on a wire rack to cool completely. It’s fantastic eaten hot or cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Savour the flavour of summer a little while longer with this delicious recipe by Clara McQuaid.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a summer of coulis in our house, and a great deal of desserts to go with it! The joy of holidays. It&#8217;s been quite a fruity revelation for me. I think that sauces often kick a dish from just regular ‘okay’ to fantastic &#8211; they add that little extra that makes all the difference in terms of taste, and usually they have the added bonus of having a pleasing aesthetic quality. A coulis is an easily made, highly versatile fruit puree. It is spectacular with pavlova and Eton mess because the tart, fruity flavour cuts through the cream and sweetness of the meringue.<br />
The turning point for me was its utility when it comes to Victoria sponges and Bakewell tarts. I use coulis where jam is usually added, and then put some in a piping bag and drizzle it over the top of the Victoria sponge that already has buttercream and fresh fruit on. Seriously delicious. The other advantage is that it can be made with fresh or frozen fruit, and it keeps for at least a week in a jar in the fridge &#8211; or you can freeze it and defrost it when you need to. I have given a few variations of ingredients here, but practically any fruit can be turned into a coulis, and you can sweeten it to your taste as you get to know the flavours better.</p>

<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>Method</em></strong></span><br />
Place all of the ingredients in a medium sized heavy-based pan and bring to the boil over a gentle heat, stirring all the time. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, or until thickened.<br />
Allow to cool and transfer the coulis to a liquidiser, or use a hand blender to puree. Finally, pass it through a sieve, pushing the pulp through with a wooden spoon to get the most out of your fruit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Or try these variations, using the same method:</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Apple</strong></span><br />
• 2 eating apples, cored and sliced with the skin still on<br />
• 1 vanilla pod scraped out<br />
• 300 mL fresh pressed apple juice<br />
• Squeeze of lemon juice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Strawberry </strong></span><br />
• 400 grams strawberries hulled and halved (or frozen)<br />
• 75 grams caster sugar<br />
• A teaspoon lemon juice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Tomato</strong></span><br />
This is not a typo! It jazzes up savoury dishes, and unlike all of the other coulis mentioned above, it needs no cooking at all &#8211; just jump straight to the liquidiser stage.This goes so well spooned over the top of fish and vegetables. Trust me.</p>
<p>• 250 grams cherry tomatoes<br />
• A large pinch of caster sugar<br />
• A teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Fatima shares a few easy ways to manage stress, with these simple but effective tips.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As human beings, we all experience stress in our everyday lives. Stress of school, work, raising kids, juggling a million and one things in a day, can cause an immense amount of stress on our bodies and minds. I’ve always been over-stressed many times, but as I’ve grown older I have begun to realise more and more that there are ways to cope with and potentially reduce the stresses in our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some ways I like to work on and manage my stress:<br />
<span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>1. Walk away</strong></span></p>
<p>I love to take breaks at work every hour or so, even if it’s for just a few minutes. Walking to the coffee machine or using the bathroom are my usual escapes. I find that it really helps to clear your head and gives you a few minutes to just think of something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>2. Just breathe</strong></span></p>
<p>So simple, but something I am not always mindful of when I feel the stress overwhelming me. Stopping for a few minutes to focus simply on your breathing can calm your brain and thoughts for a few moments and let you refocus your attention to what’s at hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>3. Wake up earlier</strong></span></p>
<p>I’ve always preferred to wake up early and get to work early, so I can leave early and get home with enough time to still have a few hours to myself to do other things. Being Muslim also aids in this, as waking up for fajr allows for waking up early and starting your day on the right foot. I find that it helps me start my day better by prayer, rather than running late and stressing out even before my day begins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>4. Take your lunch break</strong></span></p>
<p>It’s so sad and terrible to see so many people in the working world, who do not take proper lunch breaks or eat at their desks staring at their computer screen. I always try to take my lunch break because it’s SO necessary! It’s the best time for your mind to relax and think about other things, rather than all the stresses of life. Of course, some days it can be hard to take a full hour or half hour break, but studies do show the positive effects of taking a lunch break at work. It’s necessary to take a mental break and it will let you recharge for the afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>5. Stretch</strong></span></p>
<p>Again, highly recommended for your health too. Just going to the bathroom, a walk outside during lunch, or even a few steps to get your body moving, helps your posture and body. It helps alleviate muscles and can help you refocus your energy to what’s important!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30947;"><strong>6. Say No</strong></span></p>
<p>We all need a break at some point! Don’t overwork yourself to the point that you burn out. It’s important to realise what you can handle and how much, at a time. If you’re in school, have exams to study for, or are involved in tons of extracurricular and community events, sometimes it’s best to step back and realise what is a priority and what you may need to say no to for the time being. It is okay to say no and push back at times, because your mental health is the most important thing. There is no need to add stress by taking on more than you can handle!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few starting points to get your life de-stressed. Try incorporating a variety of these things and see how they help change your daily life for the better!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Introducing a brand new series, Ann (Umameer) Stock discusses the hadith of Jibreel as we begin our journey through the depths of ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day a strange man appeared in Medinah. He walked towards the gathering of the Sahabah who were sitting in a semi-circle in front of the Messenger (SAW). There was something different about him. Everyone began to turn and look in his direction. His shiny black hair contrasted with the whiteness of his skin. Why were his clothes so clean, they all wondered. They began to watch him with furrowed brows. “We do not know him, and yet he certainly does not look like a traveller.” They murmured to one another as they took another glimpse at the handsome stranger who carried himself in such a dignified manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The companions were happy when people came to ask questions.  They fell silent and watched with delight as the man approached their group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“O Messenger of Allah (SAW), shall I come nearer to you?” asked the man.<br />
“Yes,” replied the Prophet (SAW).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man knelt down, touching his knees to the front of the Prophet’s (SAW). He then placed his hands on the Prophet’s thighs and asked, “What is Islam?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) replied:  “It is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; to pay Zakaat; to fast the month of Ramadhan; and to perform Hajj to the House (Kaba).”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Then what is iman (Faith)?” the man asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) replied: “It is to believe in Allah, in His Angels, in Paradise, in the Hellfire, in resurrection after death, and in Divine Preordainment in its entirety (which is to believe that Allah I has already decreed everything that happens in our lives, both in terms of blessings and hardships.)”<br />
“Then what is Ihsan?” the man asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet (SAW) replied:  “It is to perform deeds for Allah as if you can see Him; and if you cannot see Him (which you are unable to do) (then continue to worship Him with fear, submission, sincerity, and full concentration); for indeed, He sees you.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And when is the Hour?” the man asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The one being questioned about it knows no more about it than the one asking the questions,” said the Prophet (SAW).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Then what are its signs?” the man asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“(It will be near at hand) when the naked, barefooted, poor shepherds of sheep (become wealthy and) compete with one another in the construction of buildings; and (it will be near at hand) when female slaves give birth to their masters.” Said the Prophet (SAW).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that the man left. The Prophet asked his companions to go and get him, but after searching everywhere they could find no trace of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Days passed and finally the Prophet (SAW) asked Umar (RA) “O Ibn Al-Khattaab, do you know the identity of the questioner who asked (so many questions the other day)?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Allah (SWT) and His Messenger (SAW) know best,” replied Umar (RA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That,” the Prophet (SAW) said, “was (the Angel) Jibreel. He came to teach you your religion.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that moment until this, Jibreel’s questioning of the Prophet (SAW) has taught us the meaning of Islam, Iman, Ihsan, and the signs of the Last Day. This hadith has been dutifully passed down to each generation so that Muslims would understand what constitutes being a Muslim and moreover a Muslim who has iman (faith) and Ihsan.  The lesson was so valuable that Jibreel was ordered to take a human form to deliver it and to do so before all of the Sahabah who witnessed it that day and understood the depths of its meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah states in His Glorious Quran, The bedouins say: &#8220;We believe.&#8221; Say: &#8220;You believe not but you only say, &#8216;We have surrendered (in Islam),&#8217; for Faith has not yet entered your hearts. But if you obey Allah and His Messenger (SAW), He will not decrease anything in reward for your deeds. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; Only those are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the Cause of Allah. Those! They are the truthful.  <em>(Al Hujuraat 14-15)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the hadith and ayah above indicate that being a Muslim/surrendering is different than being a Mumin/having iman. Being a Mumin is of a higher status and should be a goal for any Muslim. Just as Allah reminds the bedouins that faith doesn’t come automatically upon saying shahadah, we too should know that Islam is a journey which doesn’t end at the beginning. Knowledge and faith come with time and effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a revert, I remember the day I took my shahadah and became a Muslim.  It seems like yesterday but it&#8217;s been almost 30 years. Looking back at my journey, I have learned many things about Islam through books, lectures and classes. The more I have learned the more it has changed me and the more I have realised how little I knew then and how far I still have to go. Knowledge in Islam is vast and endless and our quest for it should be the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc1f75;"><strong>How do we attain faith?  </strong></span><br />
Imam Bukhari has informed us that iman is comprised of belief in the heart which includes our intentions. It also includes the statements that cross our tongues and the actions that our limbs take. Iman comes about with knowledge, so the more we learn and apply what we have learned to our lives, the more our hearts will be filled with belief insha Allah. Studying our deen should be an ongoing process so that we can continue to increase in iman rather than decrease, as faith is not something which remains stable but instead is in continuous flux. If it isn’t increasing, it&#8217;s decreasing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc1f75;"><strong>What are signs of faith?  </strong></span><br />
On the authority of Abu Huraira the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “Faith has over seventy branches or over sixty branches, the most excellent of which is the declaration that there is no god but Allah, and the humblest of which is the removal of what is injurious from the path: and modesty is a branch of faith.” <em>(Sahih Bukhari)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this hadith, iman/faith is compared to a tree. As it grows from the heart of the believer, more branches appear. When the roots of that tree are based upon sound and certain knowledge of Qur’an and Sunnah learned for the sake of Allah, He will insha Allah increase the faith in our hearts which will manifest itself in our behaviour. Ideally, we will be steadfast in increasing our ibadah and good deeds, following the way of the Sunnah, while abstaining from bad deeds. Hopefully this cycle would continue, although realistically we have failings and faith is not always on the increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith based on knowledge acted upon by good deeds is how the companions changed from being a divided, quarrelsome, and underdeveloped people into an Ummah which rose to unimaginable heights, changing the course of history forever. True faith today can bring about that same change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the upcoming iman series, we will attempt to increase our knowledge by examining iman in more detail. We will look at the factors Jibreel has outlined for us in the Hadith which take you from submission to belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Learn to make your very own focaccia bread with this easy recipe from Yvonne Maffei.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s such a good skill to know how to make all kinds of bread, a basic food staple, from scratch. This is a simple, no-fuss recipe for focaccia bread (an Italian flat bread). I’ve memorised it, not because I’ve made it so many times or because it’s so versatile, but simply because I’ve always felt it necessary to know the recipe without relying on a cookbook. It is made from flour, yeast, water, oil and salt &#8211; five ingredients that sustain us and fill our stomachs in times of excess, but also in times of need, Alhamdulillah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></span><br />
1 cup warm water<br />
10 g active dry yeast<br />
250 g plain flour<br />
60 ml olive oil + 2 tbs olive oil<br />
1 tsp salt</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>Method</strong></em></span><br />
1. In the bowl of a food processor or stand mixer, add warm water and drop the yeast in. Let it stand to proof for about ten minutes.<br />
2. Add 1 cup of flour along with the salt and pulse the processor, or use the dough hook of the mixer to blend thoroughly.<br />
3. Add the rest of the flour and the olive oil and mix well until you have a ball of dough that is not sticky, but is smooth and elastic.<br />
4. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise for about 30 minutes.<br />
5. On a floured counter or flat surface punch out the dough to form either a large circle or rectangular shape. Place onto a baking sheet covered in parchment paper.<br />
6. Preheat the oven to 204°C.<br />
7. Using the teeth of a fork, poke holes all over the dough. Then, using the pad of your fingers, poke the dough lightly in various places to form indentations. Cover with a towel and allow the dough to rest for another 30 minutes or until it has risen.<br />
8. Using a pastry brush, rub the extra oil all over the surface of the bread dough.<br />
9. Place the bread into the hot oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until is a golden brown on top. Be careful not to overcook or it will become very hard.<br />
10. Serve as a flat bread with olive oil for dipping or make additions to the dough before baking, such as adding cheese, cooked ground meat, or thinly sliced veggies on top.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Exotic words from old, half-forgotten books, natural ephemera and memories - Humayrah Bint Altaf unravels her love for these to Az]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Olde Sewing Room, somewhere in Bedfordshire, England. Light filters in but leaves some corners dark. Piles of books, boxes of lace, scatterings of feathers and pebbles and leaves, all quietly clamour for space. Mary, aloof in all her mannequin splendour, looks on with unseen eyes as Humayrah Bint Altaf weaves memories into skeins of gold thread and lets her needle gently pierce through fabric, in and out, in and out, leaving stories in the stitches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3563" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5.jpg" alt="img5" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img5.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least, that’s the picture my mind pieces together from the images and words that Humayrah shares with me. She tells me how what began as a foray into the world of fashion design quickly became a detour back to an old love &#8211; embroidery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I began embroidering at the age of 14 after seeing my grandma lovingly make crocheted gifts for friends and family,” says Humayrah. “I have fond memories of spending my school holidays in her home. The duck egg blue walls, hand-dyed silk saris that neatly lined her wardrobe, even the soft floral scent of her saris are still fresh in my mind. It was here that my heart became entwined in needlework and all things handmade.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humayrah says she believes that everyone is on a personal journey to Allah (SWT), and hers began while studying fashion at the University for the Creative Arts in Surrey. By the time she was in her second year there, she became discouraged by the competitiveness of the industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The constant expectation to imitate and embrace the forever changing trends on the catwalk left me feeling like I was losing my identity as a Muslimah. After much patience and prayer, I was blessed with the opportunity to study hand embroidery at the Royal School of Needlework in Hampton Court Palace. In my two years there, I developed my skills in traditional hand embroidery techniques like goldwork and silk shading, and my love and appreciation for exquisite craftsmanship blossomed.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her work seems to weave together the old with the new. “My grandparents’ belongings; lost, old objects, letters from loved ones, leaves and twigs I stumble across on evening walks, all touch me. The chiffon scarves my grandma used to crochet for me, her kohl applicator, her laces and trims; her rusty, steel scissors are all very dear to me. Alhamdulillah, I am able to find poetry wherever I look, but trying to detach myself from constantly feeling an attachment to material things is a personal struggle of mine. The very nature of this Dunya is transient, and it can sometimes feel absurd to tie yourself so tightly to things that were never meant to last. I somehow disagree with collecting just for the sake of collecting, but I strive to transform old things and make them live and be loved again.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Humayrah’s world, even the inanimate has personality. She names her embroidered pieces after people, and her mannequin may as well be her kindred soul. “One way I choose to &#8216;live&#8217; with old pieces is by naming them. Mary, my mannequin, is a fine example. Named after my love for Mary Poppins and Mary my &#8216;English name&#8217; for times when my colleagues couldn&#8217;t pronounce Humayrah. Having a mannequin is quite like having a sister, but Mary always understands and never ruins your clothes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the pictures she shares on Instagram and her listings in her Etsy store, it is easy to see that Humayrah is greatly inspired by the natural world. I ask her about where she lives, the sights and sounds she encounters, the feelings she carries back and how it all informs her work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Who is a better crafter than Allah? The influence of His natural creation is something that is woven throughout much of my work. I&#8217;ve always loved discovering beautiful things and enjoy wandering through the woods near my home, where I gather leaves, twigs, feathers and other ephemera to bring back home and preserve. I also like to incorporate the treasures I find into my embroideries and with each piece, I feel that a part of me has been embedded into my work. My favourite embroidery technique has to be goldwork because of the way the metal threads vary in colour when seen in different lights and from different angles.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3560" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img1.jpg" alt="img1" width="640" height="637" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And amongst all this are the words. Words woven into thread, exuding spirituality. “I am a &#8216;word collector&#8217;. Unusual words with wondrous meanings fascinate me. My favourite word at the moment is sonder. John Koeng describes this noun in his Dictionary Of Obscure Sorrows &#8211; “The realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own &#8211; populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness &#8211; an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words should be celebrated, says Humayrah. “Take kawaakari for example &#8211; a Japanese word meaning the gleam of last light on a river&#8217;s surface at dusk; the glow of a river in the darkness. I feel there is a spiritual mystery hidden in the folds of language, and it&#8217;s important to hem these extraordinary blessings with thankfulness. An ayah that I find incredibly stirring is when The Most High says: &#8230;A goodly word is like a goodly tree, whose roots are firmly fixed and its branches reach to the heaven&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Whenever I imagine Paradise, I imagine casting my eyes upon a magnificent library of some sort. Intricate leather etchings on golden bindings are scattered all over my sewing room. I find comfort in discovering links between past and present, and the nostalgic aroma of old books.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3561" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2.jpg" alt="img2" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img2.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s one particular book that peeks through several photos that Humayrah shares online. “The Girleen by Edith Johnstone is a cherished vintage novel I discovered on one of my weekly visits to boot sales. It has the most perfect handwritten note that always touches me &#8211; &#8216;Dorothy Bwidkin, Edale Day School, 1910 Prize for attendance.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There are times when I stitch words into weathered pages &#8211; emotions, experiences, sometimes wishes. This is something quite personal that I haven&#8217;t shared with others yet. I guess stitching words into these pieces means that their story and mine have become intertwined, like a journal really &#8211; another reason I have become attached to books. Often, the connection between words and embroidery is not apparent to anyone except me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And her atmospheric photography &#8211; is that by chance or by design? “I believe in storytelling through imagery, the comforting effect a word or photograph may have on people. A single image with a few concise words woven together is enough to whisk me away and lead me to create a certain composition. I try to keep my work room, The Olde Sewing Room, looking as atmospheric as possible, helping me to &#8216;get in the zone&#8217; whilst embroidering and photographing. Often, happy accidents happen in The Olde Sewing Room through a mixture of disorder and serendipity. I have an obsession for dark, cluttered rooms thus parts of the Olde Sewing Room are dim and unlit but entirely filled to the brim with feathers, shells, broken twigs, bowls of beads, bundles of metallic threads, handcarved wooden printing blocks and lots of clocks! This is where I feel my most authentic, happiest self, especially as I am alongside Mary, my mannequin.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your needle, my child, and work at your pattern; it will come out a rose by and by. Life is like that &#8211; one stitch at a time taken patiently and the pattern will come out all right like the embroidery&#8221; &#8211; Oliver Wendell Holmes.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Those early days of marriage with those in-love feelings may seem like a distant dream. SISTERS Marriage Coach, Megan Wyatt, discu]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What kind of marriage did you dream about when you were single? When you finally fell in love and were swept off your feet, you couldn’t wait for that moment to finally be alone with your future husband. How did you imagine it would feel like to sit alone in the car, go out to eat, or sleep next to him at night? The day of the nikkah came, your cheeks sore from smiling, and for the first time you could brush arms, then hold hands, and in the privacy of your hotel room, hug one another. Those first few moments were almost magical, weren’t they?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flash forward to today. Are you still waking up living your dream, or have you found that you both talk less over dinner, chewing in silence while your children fill the quiet with their innocent questions? Does he fall asleep after you, staying up to work on the computer instead of lying with you in bed? Where are the hugs, the text messages, and smiles when you greet each other? A mumbled “salam alaikum” seems to suffice these days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If you have resigned yourself to the belief that once the in-love stage is over, so is true love, happiness and romance, then I invite you to reconsider. There is something more, something rich, deep, and beautiful waiting for you in your marriage. But in order to find it, you will first have to dive into your own self, your own dreams. Who are you today? Whatever you want your relationship to bring to you, be it love, passion, or fulfillment, you’ll soon discover that you first have to bring those very elements into your relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are missing passion, you have to ask yourself “How passionate a person am I?” Have the years eroded your zeal for life, adventure, and your ability to experience life with all five senses? Passion comes from being truly alive, experiencing the gifts Allah (SWT) gives us fully and allowing those gifts to shape us, change us, and mend us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are missing depth in your relationship ask yourself “How deep have I allowed myself to go?” Deep with your own thoughts and feelings when you journal or ponder, and deep with your husband when something he has said or done stirs a warmth in your heart. You cannot swim in deep waters with your toes barely dipped into the shallow edges, can you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are missing love, ask yourself “How have I been loving?” As a woman, our nature is to be loving, but how have you loved your husband as the man he truly is in your life? Have you shown him love in a way that he desires, craves, and yearns for? When you love him like this, you can feel free to express your own loving desires, but it is after you have given first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To bring your marriage back to life, you have to be brave enough to dream again, to desire again, and then go after what you want. Think about the months (years) you spent searching for your husband. How many months were you preparing for the wedding and getting to know your husband? The planning and the “getting to know you” can’t stop. Not then, not now, not ever. What dream could you start planning for today?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c2769c;"><strong><em>How do you forget the past? We&#8217;ve sometimes said or done very hurtful things to each other in the past, but in every argument the past keeps being rehashed? How do we avoid this?</em></strong></span></p>
<p>One of the main reasons people continue to bring up past experiences is because the wound created by that experience has not been healed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we are hurt by someone, we often need a safe space to fully feel whatever emotions were evoked. During conflicts in our relationships, the predominant emotion is usually hurt, beneath all the other knee jerk reactions. We need to acknowledge that the hurt is there and feel it. Our tendency is to protect ourselves, so instead of feeling hurt and crying, which may come to us naturally in such a moment, we set up the “ego protection walls” to hide the hurt, appear stronger than we really are, and then move into attack mode. We start screaming, accusing, blaming, name calling, and firing stabbing words. Our spouses, in turn, hide the hurt, put up their ego protection walls, and another round of unloving and disrespectful words begins. The cycle has begun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the past is dredged up, it arrives at precisely this moment. Either an emotional wound has been touched and the pain reminds you of a previous pain that hasn’t healed yet, or out of fear of there being another painful moment, you remind your spouse of what happened in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s ironic about such a moment is that your intentions deep down are good. Your intention is to protect yourself from hurt and to release your hurt in such a way that your spouse can feel your pain and repair the damage they may have caused. However, when both of you are in defence mode no-one can repair anything, and the cycle persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #c2769c;"><strong>What’s the way out?</strong></span></p>
<p>First the ego walls have to go down. It’s scary to show your true feelings at times, but this level of vulnerability is the only door out of that dark and angry room. My husband and I have this rule we live by as much as we can: We never try to deny or minimise what each of us felt during our interactions. For example, if he says “Your comment wasn’t respectful,” then I have to agree, because no matter how I want to see it, or explain myself, the truth is for him it wasn’t respectful. For him to let go and move on, I have to accept what is true for him. If I found an action of his frustrating, he doesn’t try to explain away what I feel. It’s true for me, and it’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is little resistance in a conversation like this. Instead, we find acceptance and the ability to honour each other’s feelings without needing to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to forgive and move on, where the moment literally ends right then and there, you each need to feel heard, honoured, and finally loved. Apologies, and understanding what is at the root of an argument brings you both back together as a team again, as you both look to solve what is the true source of conflict between you. Sometimes, it’s something as simple as being tired and needing more sleep! Other times, it’s that baggage from our past being triggered in us. One of those unresolved childhood issues needs begging for attention. Whatever it may be, when you have truly felt your way through all of your feelings, honoured what you and your spouse feel, and then worked through it together, love will be restored and the past will have no need to come up again in a future conversation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Heba Alshareef gives some insider information to men looking to win the hand of a fabulous Muslimah in marriage.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me tell you about my first crush, Brian. Okay, that sounds bad, I know, but stay with me here. Brian was really cute. He was always very well groomed, his golden brown hair cut and styled to perfection. He was smart and funny. His smile was kind, his ways gentle. And he treated me like a queen. There was the time he hid behind the school fence to surprise me with a bouquet of fresh flowers he’d picked himself. And it wasn’t the flowers that delighted me, but the satisfaction I read on his face which said that he had been successful in pleasing me. There was the time when he insisted on taking me to the school cafeteria and buying me a sandwich. He held my hand and lamented when I said that I couldn’t eat ham which was the only available option (yes, I knew that ham came from pigs and was therefore haram, but I was still a bit ignorant on the boyfriend front). He actually went to the cafeteria supervisor after school and demanded that they serve more options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, Brian. He was smooth. He was my kindergarten sweetheart and I kid you not, I look back on those days and think if only he was Muslim, he would have made the perfect match for a fabulous Muslim sister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what was it about Brian that was so appealing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And how can the single Muslim guy emulate the traits that will win over the heart of his wife to be? Of course, we’re going to assume his faith is solid, as the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) has said in the hadith, “If someone with whose piety and character you are satisfied comes to you, then marry him. If you do not do so, there will be disorder in the earth and a great deal of evil.” <em>(Reported by At-Tirmidhi and others and classified as Hasan).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let there be no question that these two traits are most important, but what else can help his cause?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>1. Humility coupled with confidence</strong></span><br />
Many think that you must be humble, and indeed that is a very good thing &#8211; still, there is a way to also exude confidence. Finding the balance between the two is truly understanding the notion of ‘ihsaan’ –excellence and a sure way to be appealing to females. When said groom proposes, he must be confident that he will win the hand of his intended. He will show he is humble in his mannerisms, but absolutely sure that he can take excellent care of her and has no issues demonstrating this to her and her wali. How can she resist?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>2. Funny is good</strong></span><br />
Having a sense of humour and the ability to make your intended laugh is a trait that will serve you well throughout your long and prosperous marriages, inshaAllah. I had an aunt who, whenever her husband spoke, would stare at him with complete and utter love. The fact of the matter is that he wasn’t the best looking guy on the block &#8211; but everyone wanted to be in his company because he was so funny. May Allah have mercy on my Uncle Mahmood, his ability to make people laugh so hard was only hindered by them having to go to the bathroom constantly while he was speaking. And his wife was his biggest fan! What man wouldn’t want his wife to be his biggest fan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A woman is enamoured instantly when a light hearted chap asks for her hand in marriage because she knows that he’ll be fun. And don’t girls just want to have fun?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>3. Kindness that doesn’t dissuade from decisiveness</strong></span><br />
He buys the mom flowers, he feeds the birds in the park, he helps wash the dishes in the masjid after a potluck Ramadhan iftar. He’s kind, yes. Does this mean that he is weak though? No. Once again it’s about finding that balance between being kind (not code for “doormat”) and still able to make his own decisions. It is how a man is able to take the lead in a way that makes those around him feel safe, yet still surrounded by kindness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As always, the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) himself is the example that best exemplifies how the man should be treating his womenfolk, while still maintaining a sense of focus and determination to do what needs to be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>4. Brains</strong></span><br />
Geeks and nerds shouldn’t be hindered by their labels. Having the ability to speak to his potential mate’s doctor father about the functions of the digestive system and at the same time being able to discuss the latest PSP games with her younger brother will win the Muslim suitor some major points. Women want to be able to respect and cherish the men who they plan to spend their lives with. They don’t want some ignoramus. In the real world, fabulous Muslim women know that intellectual conversation trumps any type of “Prince Charming” fantasy. It’s what keeps things interesting, and gives us something to look forward to when the “Prince Charming” good looks begin to fade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I know that I haven’t mentioned it yet, but looking his best when he approaches his potential mate is certainly not a bad idea. My mom has a picture of my old kindergarten class and Brian really was something else in his three-piece baby blue suit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for those wondering: yes, my husband has approved this piece. He knows that he has surpassed Brian and all the traits that can win over any fabulous Muslimah. Now, brothers desperately seeking to complete half their deen, how about you?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Khurshid Khatib looks at how incorporating regular acts of charity in our lives can become a means of spiritual self-purification.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s 8:40 a.m., and my young son and I should have left the house ten minutes ago. Somehow, despite being awoken at a ridiculously early time, we are going to be late for school &#8211; again. There is a morning void, I’m sure of it &#8211; I call it ‘the lost time zone’, in which keys, shoes and coats inexplicably vanish, just when you need them. The frown on my forehead spreads across my face and, exasperated, I sigh in frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Smile, Mummy,” my son requests, and I am suddenly reminded of one of the most basic acts of charity:<br />
“Your smile for your brother is charity” <em>(Fiqh-us-Sunnah, Volume 3, Number 98)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I grin in spite of myself, the mood immediately lifted somewhat, and my son beams straight back. The smallest charitable action within this brief exchange is a simple example of how effective and easy it is to give and how sharing is often also reciprocated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charity, or Zakat, is an Islamic obligation, with the literal meaning of ‘purity’ and is one of the five pillars of belief in Islam. Muslims are required to give two and a half percent of their wealth in zakat each year, which is to be paid on the net amount remaining, after all necessary expenses have been considered. The Prophet Muhammad (SAW)  has said; &#8220;Give regular charity, for truly it is a purifier, and be kind to your relatives and acknowledge the rights of the poor, neighbours and those in need who seek your help.&#8221; <em>(Fiqh-us-Sunnah, Volume 3, Number 3)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadaqah is a voluntary charitable donation and can be given at any time. It can also be reflected through the kindness and consideration of others and not only through financial contributions. Abu Hurairah (RA) reported that the Prophet (SAW) said,  “A good word is charity; administering justice between two people is charity”. If someone “performs good deeds and keeps away from evil deeds, then that will be regarded as a charitable deed.&#8221; <em>(Bukhari)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Islamic history gives many examples of women who have demonstrated philanthropic qualities. Zainab Bint Jahsh (RA), a wife and sahabah (companion) of the Prophet (SAW) was renowned for her generous nature; she would use the earnings made from selling her handiwork to spend on the needy. She became known as ‘The Mother of the Poor’, through reaching the most vulnerable in society, in particular, orphans and widows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Queen Zubayda, the wife of the ninth century Caliph Harun Ar-Rasheed of the Abbasid dynasty, was a well-educated and influential woman. She used her immense wealth to build a large number of wells to vastly improve the route that pilgrims took when travelling from Iraq to Makkah. Following her Hajj pilgrimage, Zubayda also observed the scarcity of water around areas of ‘Arafat and Mina and used her resources to build a canal. This canal provided free drinking water, continuing to do so for over a thousand years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As royalty, Queen Zubayda enjoyed the privileges that came with her lifestyle but was also aware of her people’s needs and recognised the responsibilities that automatically came with financial prosperity. Acquiring wealth is often regarded negatively, but it is greed for money, rather than money itself, which can become a source of trouble amongst us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the ninth century, Fatima al-Fihri of Fez, Morocco used her substantial inheritance (following the death of her husband and brothers) to found the al Qarawiyyin Mosque, which later became the oldest degree-granting University in the world. Her legacy was, and still is, the gift of education. Similarly, her sister Maryam used her own wealth to build the Al-Andalus Mosque, also in Fez.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Islam places particular emphasis on intention in all our actions, and this is to be remembered when giving zakat. It is best to give discreetly, remembering that our deeds are between Allah (SWT) and ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scholar Ibn Taymiyyah said, ‘The soul of one who gives Zakat is blessed and so is his wealth’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #d69a72;">“The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.”</span></em></strong>  <em>(Al-Baqarah:261)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sharing of wealth is also a lesson in humility. When we give to the needy, we are not only acknowledging their suffering and hopefully alleviating some of their hardships; we are also realising empathy in our hearts. It is easy to be conscious of what is lacking in our lives and make comparisons with those who appear to have more that we do, and this is one of the reasons why charity has been likened to spiritual purification. Genuine and frequent charitable acts will cultivate a habit of gratefulness for the positive aspects of our lives, that perhaps we had not previously recognised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How we spend our good fortune is a test of character; we can enjoy the benefits of having wealth, but at the same time remain mindful of our roles within society and the contributions that we can make to improve it. Whilst it is an important duty to endeavour to provide for your family and loved ones, it must be remembered that those of us that have a roof over our heads and regular food on the table are already rich.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also been advised to &#8220;Be in this life as if you were a stranger or a traveller on a path&#8221; <em>(Ibn Umar)</em>. This is a reminder that our lives are a journey; as travellers, we do not require or become attached to an excess of worldly goods. When we genuinely free ourselves from the love of possessions and realise that everything comes from Allah (SWT), we accept that all of our belongings are, effectively, on a short-term loan; these belongings are as temporary as our mortal lives here on earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I rummage around for missing items, yet again during ‘the lost time zone’, with the clock ticking away in the background, I realise that this last hadith is one that my son and I would benefit from by putting into practice. I may choose to blame an imaginary metaphysical void in time, but perhaps this is easier than admitting that I have too many items scattered about my house! Well, they do say that charity begins at home&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Life coach, Sayeda Habib explains the concept of love languages so we can enhance the love we all experience day to day. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Assalaamu &#8216;alaikum sisters! I imagine you’ll agree with me when I say that one desire that we share is the desire to be loved. I’ve yet to meet a sister who hasn’t wanted to feel loved; yet, many of us feel unloved a great deal of the time. This isn’t because we don’t have people who love us. Instead, we feel unloved because we are not recognising the way in which someone is loving us. Confused yet? I imagine you may be. Let me explain through Sister Rashida’s* example. She came to coaching because she was struggling in her marriage; she felt that her husband didn’t love her at all. He would take care of all her material needs, make sure she and the kids were looked after, yet she felt unloved. When we began exploring a bit further, she began to understand that she felt love when it was expressed in words such as “I love you” or “you look beautiful”. However, her husband’s way of expressing love was by doing things for her. He did small things for her around the house, made sure that she didn’t want for anything &#8211; that was his way of showing love. In time, she began to understand that his way of expressing love was different to hers; he loved her a great deal, but in the way that he knew how to love. She learnt how to teach him about her needs and appreciate his gestures more as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love is both complicated and simple. The complex part involves enhancing self-confidence and feeling worthy of receiving love; this is about our relationship with ourselves. The simple part of love is about expressing love for others and fully receiving the love that’s coming our way. We have explored self-esteem before and we will again. However, this time, our focus is on the simple part of love. Focus in on the people who are most important to you. Would you like them to truly feel the love you have for them? Would you like to feel deeply loved and appreciated by them? Today, we will learn about how we can enhance our experience of emotional love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Begin by asking yourself the following questions:<br />
• On a scale of 1-10, how loved am I feeling right now?<br />
• Who are the people who I feel love me the most?<br />
• How do I know (and feel) that they love me? (What do I see, feel, hear and experience that tells me that they love me?)<br />
• Are there times I don’t experience feeling loved? Why or why not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expressing love is a need for us through all of our relationships, whether with our parents, siblings, friends or spouse. Let’s think of expressing love as a form of communication, one that we will think of as our love language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>So what is a love language?</strong></span><br />
Let’s go back to Communication 101 for a moment. The first thing we think of as communication are the words we speak. Our words, in fact, make up a very small percentage of our overall communication. The way people communicate includes their body language, vibes, actions, words and even thoughts. So, the ways in which we express/experience love can be termed as our “love language”. This includes our thoughts, actions, body language and words around expressing love. Just as every human being has their unique way of thinking about life, they also have their preferred way of feeling and expressing love. Choose one relationship in your life where you want to feel more loved and then take this short quiz to start exploring your love language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I feel really wonderful when<br />
A. I’m told I am loved or appreciated.<br />
B. My family or loved ones spend uninterrupted quality time with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I feel more loved when<br />
A. I’m given words of encouragement.<br />
B. My loved one helps me with the housework or does something I need done (without me having to ask).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I truly feel loved when<br />
A. My loved one tells me I did a great job with a meal.<br />
B. They give me a gift or a card just for no reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I feel more loved when<br />
A. When I hear “I love you”.<br />
B. When I get a hug or my loved one holds my hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. I feel more loved when<br />
A. I hear loving and encouraging words.<br />
B. I get a card, a flower or a gift for no reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loving words: If you found yourself ticking “A” most often, then you experience love when you’re encouraged through words. You need to hear encouragement for your efforts and be told that you’re loved. If this is the way you feel love, then you express it in this way as well. If you find yourself saying “I love you” then it could be your primary desire to hear these words too. Encouragement and being told you’re loved goes a long way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Quality time:</strong></span> If you selected that, then you truly feel loved when people spend time with you. This doesn’t mean sitting with you while on the phone; instead, you want to feel that you have your loved one’s or friend’s real attention. They look at you and listen to you. You feel heard and that’s when you feel a sense of being loved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Acts of service:</strong></span> If you prefer that your son keeps his room clean or your husband takes the garbage out without being asked, then your preferred way of feeling loved is this one. You feel loved when people do things that you need done. You may also be doing things for them to show them that you care. If this is your way of feeling love, then you probably express it in the same way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Gifts:</strong> </span>If you feel on top of the world when you get a rose or a card, then this is the way you feel truly loved. You may be one of those people who loves giving small gifts as a surprise &#8211; if your friends give you something, whatever it is, you cherish it. Receiving gifts doesn’t mean that they need to be expensive, it’s the thought that counts &#8211; and a small token goes a long way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Physical touch:</strong> </span>Are you someone who hugs your family and friends a lot? Then you prefer to experience love by receiving the same. It may be that your special someone holds your hand or touches your arm as they walk by. Small gestures of touch allow you to feel loved and keep you fulfilled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all have a combination of ways in which we feel love. The idea here is to explore which is the one you most prefer. Ask your loved ones to take the test and you may find the results surprising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #47b3b3;"><strong>Tip:</strong> Give love &#8211; but in their language</span><br />
Now you can begin to explain to your loved ones what you need to feel loved. Next, learn about your family members&#8217; or spouse’s preferred love language. Learn one or two new ways in which you can express your love, but in the way that they prefer. This will impact your relationship in a wonderful way. When your loved ones feel fulfilled, they will also want to give the love back &#8211; you can teach them about what you need as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that you found the quiz insightful and useful as well. Insha Allah we can all enhance our experience of love. First learn to love through your loved ones’ preferred ways and then gently request of them to care for you in the small ways you need. My warmest wishes for you on this wonderful and heartwarming journey.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Cycling may be the greenest way to get around but, as Arwa Aburawa knows firsthand, cycling for many Muslimahs entails a myriad of]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I bought a bike as an adult, I did so when my mum was on holiday. I only cycled late at night so none of my neighbours would see me and practised in a park in the next town along. After my mother returned, I found one morning that my lovely red Rayleigh had been dismantled and the parts distributed to the local boys. One took the chain as a spare and the other made use of the wheels. You could say that my first foray into cycling hadn&#8217;t exactly gone smoothly, but I also wasn&#8217;t surprised. Even though I&#8217;ve lived in the UK all my life, I was told as a young girl that it wasn&#8217;t &#8216;appropriate&#8217; for a Muslim girl to cycle. Especially one who wore a hijab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, that didn&#8217;t stop me developing a deep fascination for bikes and cycling. As corny as this sounds, they became a symbol of freedom and liberation for me. My fascination only grew when I became involved in environmental campaigning where the bike is hailed as the ultimate green and healthy form of transport. Cycling is cheap, it keeps you healthy and happy and produces absolutely zilch carbon emissions, unlike cars or even buses and trains. So why wasn&#8217;t I cycling? Not an easy question to answer, especially to my cycling friends who didn&#8217;t really understand the cultural barriers that I, and many Muslim women who want to cycle, face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
And it is cultural barriers. Attitudes towards Muslimahs on bikes are diverse. Whilst it&#8217;s very much frowned upon in the Middle East, Algerians seem to have no issue with it &#8211; I have an Algerian friend whose dad insists she cycles even though she hates it. We both enjoy the irony of our situation. In some Asian countries, the sight of a Hijabi woman on a bike or moped doesn&#8217;t stir the slightest bit of interest. Indeed, I&#8217;ve always found it rather amusing that the humble bicycle could be seen as a threat to the &#8216;virtue&#8217; of Muslim women. Even after I&#8217;d cottoned on to the underlying reason to the objections raised by my mum when I was young, I still thought it was all a bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a lump of metal and wheels that happens to transport you from A to B!&#8221; I told my  mum. Yet cycling as a Muslim women is seen as subversive in the Middle Eastern culture from which I hail. Can all this fuss really be about my hymen? And yes, the hymen is what we are talking about, as it is, apparently, one and the same thing as being virtuous. Or is this about the fact that cycling makes you independent and self-sufficient? It&#8217;s free, you don&#8217;t need to pay for petrol or insurance, and you need nothing but your two legs to take you wherever you want to go &#8211; something which is particularly threatening if you happen to be single as well as female.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent award-winning film by Saudi Arabian director Haifaa Al Mansour called &#8216;Wadjda&#8217; tells the story of a young girl living in Riyadh who becomes obsessed with a green bike at her local store. She wants to race with the boy in her neighbourhood, but soon cultural pressure from her mother and father thwart her efforts to buy the bike. A Qur&#8217;an recitation competition with a cash prize is her last resort to acquiring her beloved green bike. &#8220;I remember when I was a kid, my father took me along with my brothers to get bicycles and I chose a green one,&#8221; explains Al Mansour who is the first female Saudi filmmaker. &#8220;I am extremely lucky to have a father who wanted me to feel dignified as a woman, but it was definitely a different story for my classmates and friends who would have never even dreamed of asking for a bicycle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the heart of the story [of the film] is something anyone can relate to, which is the idea of being labeled different or deviant for wanting something outside of what is traditionally considered acceptable,&#8221; continues Al Mansour. &#8220;The Saudi culture can be especially brutal and unforgiving to people who fall out of step with the society, so there is a real fear of being labeled an outcast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social and cultural pressure is at the heart of why many Muslim women are forbidden from cycling. It is not deemed as very lady-like and is also seen a threat to a girl&#8217;s reputation. I for one would like to challenge that. I recently decided that I would try cycling again, years after my first failed attempt. I went on a free adult cycling training course, got on the bike and was soon cycling around the park with a huge smile on my face. It was as liberating as I imagined it would be and let me tell you this: so much fun. I would certainly not be giving up my bike without a fight this time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Green Facts of Cycling</strong></span><br />
• Bicycles currently save over 238 million gallons of petrol every year<br />

<p>Spring time is crumble time. Well, that&#8217;s not quite true: any time is crumble time really, its always a crowd pleaser. But in spring when you are not quite out of the Winter but not yet into the Summer, it&#8217;s nice to combine the fresh fruitiness of the beckoning summer with comforting warm crumbliness that&#8217;s reminiscent of chillier days. Anyway, there&#8217;s no need to justify baking this treat.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5.<br />
Butter a 1.5 litre ovenproof dish. Peel, core and thinly slice the apples, mix with the jam and orange juice and spread evenly over the dish.<br />
Mix together the oats, flour and cinnamon in a large bowl. Add the butter in small pieces and rub in gently. Stir in the sugar and rub again. Drizzle over the syrup and mix with a knife so it starts to come together and form clumps.<br />
Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the apples.<br />
Bake for about half an hour until the apples start to bubble beneath the mixture.<br />
Allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving with custard, cream or ice cream&#8230;or all of the above!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[From Safaa Baig’s debut novel we meet sixteen-year old Katie Anderson whose charismatic father just turned her charming world up]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In Safaa Baig’s debut novel, sixteen-year old Katie Anderson thinks she is living the perfect teenage life, with a hilarious and fun family, average grades, a subscription to OK! Magazine, exclusive invitations to all the high-end parties and enough popularity at college to make every other girl want to be like her… that is, until her sensational, divorced father makes a decision that changes her life completely; he accepts Islam. Just a week before college is set to re-open, Katie finds her entire world shifting from beneath her. Engulfed with a mixture of confused feelings, a sudden change in lifestyle and a desire to battle her way back to normalcy, she begins a monumental search for guidance that will change her life forever…</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad! Where have you been? You were supposed to call the minute you got back. You promised,&#8221; I scolded him over the phone, only seconds after answering it.<br />
He chuckled, &#8220;Hey pumpkin, I missed you. I was going to call but… I got caught up with a few things.”<br />
“Like?”<br />
“You’ll know in due time.”<br />
“What,” I asked with exaggerated annoyance, “is up with all this secrecy? First Mark, then mum and now you —”<br />
“Guess what? I&#8217;ve got a surprise for you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You know that&#8217;s not gonna work, Dad. I’m not a child anymore, so stop —”<br />
“Look outside your window.”<br />
“What?”<br />
“I said look outside —”<br />
“Why?” I interrupted him, turning my body so that I was now facing my bedroom window. I peered at it cautiously, wondering if he’d planted some sort of prank there.<br />
“It’s a surprise,” he sang softly, obviously incredibly amused by the scenario.<br />
“No,” I replied, folding my arms defiantly as if he was actually there, watching me.<br />
“All right, well then…” he drew out his words, sounding surprised, “you’re missing out. Big time. I mean, who knows what could be lurking behind that window —”<br />
“Dad, I am so not falling for —”<br />
“I mean, do I know? Yeah. But do you? Nah, not so much.”<br />
“Dad.”<br />
“But then again, that’s just the choice you’ve made. And I’ve got to respect that, even if it means you’re missing out on something irrefutably astounding and unquestionably phenomenal —”<br />
“Oh, come on! Dad, don’t pull out the vocabulary card. That’s not fair —”<br />
“It saddens me to inform you of this, but Katie, my dear, you are a bromide.”<br />
I gasped, “I am not!” Mentally, I was wondering if he’d made up that word or if it actually existed. “I am not a bromide,” I said again with more vehemence, “I am the farthest thing from a bromide,” I continued, pulling a dictionary out from my bookshelf and flipping through it speedily, “if ever there was a person who was a bromide, it would not be me, for I am not a —”<br />
My dad laughed at the other end, “You won’t find it in the dictionary.”<br />
I scowled, “Fine, well then —” and stopped mid-sentence as I heard a loud honk outside. Furrowing my brow, I opened my mouth again, only to be stopped short again by another honk, this time sounding suspiciously as if it was coming from outside my window. Standing up slowly, I moved curiously towards my window, and pulled back the curtain in one swift move.<br />
“You were saying?” he asked, as I suddenly caught sight of a very familiar red Honda Accord Euro, with my dad seated inside, grinning broadly.<br />
I burst out laughing as I watched him wave at me comically. “Nice surprise, huh, Katie?”<br />
“Best surprise,” I giggled, “Give me five minutes and I&#8217;ll be down.”<br />
&#8220;No need, I&#8217;m coming in. I have to talk to your mum about a few things. Take your time,&#8221; he replied, stepping out of the car.<br />
&#8220;A few things? What?&#8221; I asked, impatiently.<br />
&#8220;Just need a few words with your mum. Okay, I&#8217;m gonna hang up now… because I&#8217;m here for goodness sake,&#8221; he laughed loudly and then hung up.<br />
I smiled to myself and skipped downstairs to welcome him. I reached the bottom of the staircase just as Mark opened the door and my smile slowly crept away as I saw Mark’s face turn livid.<br />
&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; I heard Mark demand, and I instantly slowed my steps.<br />
&#8220;I came to get Katie… look, Mark, it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. It’s… I… I miss you,&#8221; my dad said gently, his cheerless eyes resting upon Mark&#8217;s.<br />
&#8220;This is the only way, Dad… Jack. Katie&#8217;ll be down in a few minutes. You can wait outside,&#8221; he remarked gloomily, as he began to close the door.<br />
&#8220;Wait! Mark, what do you think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; I asked angrily as I ran up to the front door, pushing Mark out of the way to allow my dad in.<br />
Mark glowered at my dad as he coldly replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get to you, Katie,&#8221; and stomped out of the room.<br />
&#8220;Now, see, that’s someone I’d call a bromide,” I winked, “Don&#8217;t let him get to you, okay?&#8221;<br />
He laughed as he pulled me in for a tight hug, &#8220;I missed you so much, Kay.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It was your own fault for staying in Morocco for six months,&#8221; I joked, my voice muffled against his shirt.<br />
&#8220;Architect Extraordinaire on the job,&#8221; he grinned, holding me back to look at me. “You’ve grown.”<br />
“You say that every time you see me,” I rolled my eyes.<br />
“No, I mean it —”<br />
&#8220;What&#8217;s going on? I just saw Mark fuming in the living room,&#8221; my mum inquired as she suddenly walked into the room, a look of surprise on her face as she noticed my dad.<br />
&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re here early,&#8221; she said, seating herself on the sofa.<br />
&#8220;Drama, drama, drama. Dad needs to talk to you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yeah, there are a few things I need to discuss with you,&#8221; he added, then taking in my inquisitive eyes, chuckled, &#8220;privately.”<br />
&#8220;Oh sure, that&#8217;s nice. Get rid of me already. I&#8217;ll be in the living room,&#8221; I sighed as I went off to question Mark on his strange behaviour.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Khalida Haque explores this most tenuous of relationships and offers some tips on how we might make things more harmonious.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we’ve decided to get married. We’ve found the perfect partner. He ticks all the boxes on our spouse checklist and more. But wait a minute &#8230; what’s this? There’s a mother &#8230; and a father &#8230; an older brother &#8230; a younger brother &#8230; half a dozen sisters &#8230; nephews &#8230; nieces &#8230; But what does it mean? Does this mean the end of the marital paradise we had only just been envisaging?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All too often, when we are looking to get married, we focus on the person we are hoping to wed – his character and attributes. We forget that he may come with an entourage, and a large one at that. Or we may insist that we live completely separate from ‘the family’ as we fear them taking over our lives, and in doing so ensure that we remain ‘outlaws’ and outsiders whilst our husbands become human ping pong balls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there are families in which, no matter what we do, we will remain the outlaw. There are mothers who will never see their sons as anything but theirs and we will be cast as the ‘other woman’ from the moment we agree to marry their sons. So what do we do? Hold out for an orphan? Not too many of them around. Below are some ways we might overcome some of the difficulties that might arise during the course of our marriages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Clarify intentions</strong></span><br />
Anything done for the sake of Allah (SWT), fi sabeelillah, cannot be wrong. Marriage and relationships founded on the wish to please Him and Him alone seem to be easier despite the hardships they inevitably encounter. Intentions will need to be continually renewed as there will be times that our egos may take a little hammering, particularly when we feel we have done something well, for the right reasons, or have worked hard but have not been acknowledged. For example, we’ve invited all the in-laws around for dinner, slaved all day in the kitchen and been the most gracious of hostesses, only for the food and/or the house and/or our clothes and/or any number of things to be either criticised or looked down upon. I recall hearing from a Shaykh that when our egos become bruised, we need to examine the extent to which our nafs was involved in what we did. The degree to which we are hurt is the degree to which we acted according to our nafs and in search of praise and appreciation. When we do things with the intention of servitude to Allah (SWT), then the reward is ours whether or not others acknowledge what we have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Think of own family and parents</strong></span><br />
‘Do unto others as we would have done unto us’. Imagine how we would like to see our own family, and, in particular, our parents treated. Yes, as clarified in the May edition of Sisters (Caring for our parents: finding the balance) a son is responsible for the care of his own parents and a wife’s duty is to her own, but what harm would it do to aid our husbands in the care of their parents. Would we not wish the same from our partners and the spouses of our own siblings towards our parents? Showing the level of care towards our in-laws that we show our own parents can serve to increase the love between us, especially when they know that we are not in any way duty-bound or obligated to do so but that we choose to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Step into our mother-in-law’s shoes</strong></span><br />
Or any of our in-laws’ footwear. Just as things are changing for us as a consequence of our marriage, so they change for them. Perhaps not to the same degree for all the in-laws but, even so, an adjustment is necessary to accommodate the addition to the family. Think about a new addition to our own lives, either through marriage or birth: how the person who is now married or has given birth is no longer available in the same way. Likewise, we need to be sensitive to what our in-laws might perceive as a loss. If we can show them that they are in fact gaining rather than losing, we will have achieved a tremendous thing. Also, if we remind ourselves that our husbands’ mothers, our mothers-in-law, can never be repaid by their sons for bearing and rearing them, as no mother can be, we can remain appreciative of what they have done – particularly if our husbands are kind, loving, and well-mannered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Build relationships</strong></span><br />
Get to know each member of your new family individually when and if possible by spending time with them, with and without your husband. As we know, any relationship requires time and effort and what we put in is often what we get out. Make the effort and you will, bi’idhnillah, reap the rewards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Discussion</strong></span><br />
Have a discussion, preferably before marriage, about how you and your spouse will handle different scenarios that might arise, alongside what you expect from each other with regards to your families. If you are clear from the outset what is wanted, then problems are less likely to occur and if they do, you know where you stand. Talking about things as they arise and expressing yourselves facilitates understanding, whilst keeping quiet and bottling things up creates tension. Always consider it as teamwork; you are on the same side wanting what is best for each other and for the family as a whole. If you do, it is more probable that the two of you will to work together as opposed to against each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Patience and gratitude</strong></span><br />
Focus on the positive characteristics. Be grateful for these. Be patient with the difficult stuff. We all need to remind ourselves of how much we have and how much worse off we could always be. Sabr and shukr, as they say, are wonderful things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #bf0000;"><strong>Be respectful but be just</strong></span><br />
We also need to remember that our in-laws are our husbands’ blood relatives as well as our children’s. Some, especially the parents-in-law, will be our elders and as such, we need to be respectful &#8211; but that does not mean we should put up with anything:<br />
<em><strong><span style="color: #bf0000;">“O you who believe! Stand firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even if it be against yourselves, your parents, and your relatives, or whether it be against the rich or poor &#8230;”</span></strong> (An-Nisa: 135)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #bf0000;">&#8230; Do not oppress and do not be oppressed.”</span> </strong>(Al-Baqarah: 279)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: &#8216;Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or is oppressed.&#8217; A man asked: &#8216;O Messenger of Allah! I (know how to) help him when he is oppressed, but how can I help him when he is an oppressor?&#8217; He (SAW) said: &#8216;You can restrain him from committing oppression. That will be your help to him.&#8217; <em>(Bukhari &amp; Muslim)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if a mother-in-law insists on you doing something that is culturally a tradition but is outside the bounds of Islam, for example, hugging your adult brother-in-law, you can simply state that this is something you are not willing to do and provide an explanation if necessary and asked for. I am aware that things can feel pressured when these sorts of differences arise. However, if you are firm but polite, confident yet compassionate, then, insha Allah, the message will get across.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship with in-laws can be a difficult one or it can be a fruitful one. We need to recognise our part in making it a success and work towards it. If we do, we will become part of the family and the days of being an outlaw will be far behind us, bi’idhnillah.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Make peanut butter on the fly with Yvonne Maffei’s recipe for a homemade spread.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can something so simple not be made at home? Peanut butter is such a favourite food spread for kids (and many adults) that it’s a shame not to have it freshly made. It’s quick and easy to make and simple enough to make a jar a week and even pass some along to family and friends as edible gifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Makes about 1 ½ cups</em><br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #b87e02;">Ingredients</span></em></strong><br />
• 142 g (1 cup) unsalted, roasted and shelled peanuts<br />
• ½ tsp salt, or to taste<br />
• 28 g raw cane sugar, or to taste<br />
• 1½ cups peanut or safflower oil<br />
<span style="color: #b87e02;"><strong><em>Method</em></strong></span><br />
In a food processor, pour the peanuts, salt and sugar. Blend until the nuts have been completely crushed.<br />
Add the oil half a cup at a time, while continuing to blend, until you reach the desired consistency of peanut butter. For a crunchier peanut butter, add a few more peanuts and process them slightly, not until completely smooth.<br />
Pour into a container that can be sealed tightly and store in the refrigerator upside down. When ready to use, turn over and use a fork or spoon to mix the oil back into the peanut butter. Keeps fresh for about two weeks.</p>

And remember, frozen berries work just as well as fresh ones and they are less expensive!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ J. Samia Mair looks at how we can raise our children in non-Muslim lands to be proud of their faith. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My children who live in the United States see and hear anti-Islamic statements or are the ‘beneficiaries’ of anti-Islamic policies on a regular basis &#8211; and I suspect that is the same for other children living in non-Muslim lands. They hear reports on the news, read inaccuracies in books, overhear an adult conversation, to list just a few examples. It is a fact of life and one that I do not believe parents can or should shelter them from &#8211; our children need to learn how to be proud Muslims in the midst of unfair criticisms and negative perceptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember when I was invited to speak at a conference sponsored by the CDC in Atlanta. I worked in public health at the time and it was the first time my colleagues there were going to see me in a hijab. I was dreading the trip as previous experience taught me that my new look had consequences, mostly negative. I had a mantra that I kept repeating to myself from the airport &#8211; to my hotel &#8211; on my walk to the lecture &#8211; as I approached the podium &#8211; and right before I began to speak, “I am a proud and beautiful Muslim woman. I am a proud and beautiful Muslim woman”. We have a right to be proud as Muslims. We have that right because our values and our system of norms are from Allah (SWT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an adult it is much easier to be Muslim among Islamophobes, to wear that hijab when you know what it represents to some people, to pray in the parking lot when people are staring, to bring your Qur’an on the airplane even though it may get you kicked off. But for our tweens and teens, that tender age of emotions, peer importance, and the desire to fit in makes it more difficult for many. So what do we do? I certainly am not an expert; my efforts are a continual work in progress &#8211; trials and errors, failures and successes, tears and joy. But what I have learned so far from my experience and the experience of other parents is the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Role modelling</strong></span><br />
If we want our children to feel blessed to be Muslim and unafraid to let the world know it, we had also better be. Children are copycats and if anyone sees behaviour or attitudes that she doesn’t like in her children, she should look to herself (and her husband) first. If you are afraid to pray in public when prayer time is running out, it is likely they will too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Peers</strong></span><br />
Muslim children need to hang out around other Muslim children. That doesn’t mean that they can’t have non-Muslim friends; it means they need close, practising Muslim friends to strengthen their deen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Knowledge of the deen</strong></span><br />
If they know their deen, they will be able to recognise the myriad of inaccuracies and outright lies about Islam that persist in an Islamophobic environment and more able to set others straight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Media awareness</strong></span><br />
The more they understand the media’s agenda and biases, the more they will not be affected by it and the more they will understand why other people are. My daughter has become a critic of the nightly news. She is learning to question the motives of the source of her information and to wonder what information she is not being told. She wants to hear about issues that concern her. She no longer listens to the news thinking that whatever is said is the truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>A sense of justice</strong></span><br />
“But that’s not fair” is something most parents have heard a lot. Children have a sense of justice, and throughout life they will face many things that don’t seem fair, including how they may be treated. Children need to learn what Islam says about ‘justice’, and understanding it in the context of Allah’s (SWT) will and <em>qadr</em> for a proper perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>A sense of humility</strong></span><br />
Being ‘proud’ does not mean that you feel superior to anyone. None of us knows what our end will be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Confidence</strong></span><br />
We all need confidence to speak out against something accepted by the majority or act in a manner not in sync with the secular norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Commitment on our part</strong></span><br />
A parent needs to be committed to creating an environment to counteract anti-Islamic influences. We might have to drive an hour once a week for a play date with a Muslim friend or to don the hijab around disapproving relatives or take classes ourselves so we can teach our children the deen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This looks like a long list and there are undoubtedly more that could be added to it. But as parents, we are doing these things anyway in other aspects of raising our children, whether it be helping them to succeed in school, promoting loving relationships with non-Muslim relatives, or driving them to a football game. These same efforts just need to be extended towards cultivating in our children a love of Islam such that no matter what anyone says, they are grateful to be Muslim and unafraid to make it known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>O Allah, unto You do I complain of my weakness, of my helplessness, and of my lowliness before men. O Most Merciful of the merciful, You are Lord of the weak. And You are my Lord. Into whose hands will You entrust me? Unto some far-off stranger who will ill-treat me? Or unto a foe whom You have empowered against me? I care not, so You have not wrath with me. But You favouring help &#8211; that were for me the broader way and the wider scope! I take refuge in the light of Your countenance whereby all darknesses are illuminated and the things of this world and the next are rightly ordered, lest You make descend Your anger upon me, or lest Your wrath beset me. Yet is it Yours to reproach until You are well pleased. There is no power and no might except through You.</em> (Du’a the Prophet (SAW) made after being rejected and wounded in Ta’if)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this special post to SISTERS online, Nazir Al-Mujaahid of Outstanding Muslim Parents offers some of his best parenting advice.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How would you answer the question, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people would define themselves through their profession, for example, a doctor or a teacher. Others may define themselves by their cultural background, such as Arab or American. Other still may simply say, “I’m only a mother”. Many times, how people describe themselves is a reflection of how they feel about themselves and in the case of our children, we want them to radiate high self esteem and feel incredible about who they are!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge of crafting an identity and strong personality in our children isn’t as difficult as it sounds if you start early. Think of yourself as a farmer. No, not the kind that toils in a field which is essential to healthy eating, but one that toils something more precious because the soil is more valuable. I want you to till your children’s brains and how they view themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As parents we see how verbal abuse can damage a person’s perception of themselves and how bullying damages a person’s self-esteem. We can engage our children by building them up. Always remember that there are two ways to have the tallest building, one is to build it strong and tall and the other is to tear down all the other buildings around it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I advise you to tell your child how beautiful and intelligent they are over and over keeping in mind that repetition is the mother of learning. It doesn’t matter the stage that your child is in, just try it. In Stage One (1 – 7 years old), Stage Two (8 – 13 years old), or Stage Three (Teenagers), they love to hear compliments and praise, even if they act like they don’t. As a mother or father, is it true that we enjoy hearing compliments? It helps us to feel appreciated and strengthens our iman, insha Allah reminding us to be grateful to Allah (SWT) for that blessing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Stage One</strong></span></p>
<p>Let’s take little Aisha for example. She’s in Stage One at 5 years old. Being young she imitates her mother and plays with her headscarves. She tries them on, prays while wearing them, and she looks so cute! One of the best things you can do when for a young child who is exploring hijab (or anything positive) is to compliment her. Tell her how beautiful she looks and how she is obeying the command of Allah (SWT) by praying, and include other compliments you can give, which when coupled by hugs and/or kisses creates a strong healthy positive neuro-association in their brains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great way to help our children cement their belief is for you to talk to others about them in a positive way where they can hear you. For example sharing with a friend, relative, or spouse you may say how Aisha is so intelligent because she figured out how to complete a math problem or how she’s so creative and artsy because of a drawing she made. This helps breed confidence and before our children know what to think, they borrow our belief in their self until they fully exude it. I call this “planting seeds” which is the most important part of farming because without a seed there is nothing to cultivate and absolutely no harvest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Stage Two</strong></span></p>
<p>Our children’s sphere of influence grows rapidly when they turn school age and are around others who have different experiences. In Stage Two (8 – 13 years old), as they have more exposure and use the internet, they have already formed opinions and perceptions. Now that we are planting seeds we must cultivate those seeds by making sure they are properly fed, watered, and allow the sunshine to reach that soil. Constantly reminding our children of their intelligence, beauty, and at the same time challenging them to stretch themselves by doing more or learning more is part of that cultivation. Allow them enough independence to make mistakes and learn from them while understanding that they are children and not little adults in Stage Two (8 – 13 years old). Letting them dress themselves as they desire, teaching them to make up their beds, clean their rooms, wash the dishes, and understand that doing chores is a part of the first great team they are a part of and it’s called family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must remember that the difficulty with parenting lies with the fact that there is constant conflict with other forces outside of our control, whether it be relatives that don’t share your values, people that don’t share our Islamic beliefs, or the media that makes all kinds of filth look attractive. The sad reality is that by the time a child is 18 years old, they have seen an average of 200,000 acts of violence including 40,000 acts of murder on various media, which can have a profound impact on human psychology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In every stage of our children’s growth, planting and cultivating is a never-ending process and is essential to the way our children grow their personalities. I’m sure you have recognized that your children have their own personalities along with their list of likes and dislikes which may differ from ours. I use a personality test that I feel is one of the best tools I’ve seen when it comes to human psychology and it’s free to use! It’s called the Briggs-Meyer’s Personality Test and I think everyone should take it in order to discover their personality type. When you understand yourself at a deeper level, it will help with all of your relationships especially with your spouse and children. Children 8 years and older can also take the free test at the link at the end of this article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Stage Three</strong></span></p>
<p>In Stage Three (teenage years) is when we begin to reap the harvest of our actions or inactions. During the early teen years as our children’s bodies develop and they go through puberty is when there tends to be a lot of emotional uncertainty due to hormonal changes as they transition through the process. We must be that much more strategic in our praise by reminding them of successes they’ve had and lessons they’ve learned from things they may have failed at. In the Coach role, we build them up and continue to support them on their road to independence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing we must do as Muslims is to infuse the lessons we have learned from the Seerah of the Prophet (SAW) and from the Qur’an. If we only focused on our children’s psychology without infusing our Islamic beliefs then we are doing our children a disservice. Reminding our children of the jealousy of siblings we can share the story of Prophet Yusuf (RA) or when dealing with children’s stormy relationships with their fathers we can share with them the story of Prophet Nuh (RA) or Prophet Ibrahim (RA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reminding our children of how the Prophet (SAW) was slandered and boycotted, and how even his near relatives despised him during his da’wah can help our children hold Islam as relevant today as opposed to simply historic events. Teaching our children of how his patience was rewarded is also essential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must also balance the amount of times our children hear the words “no” and “don’t” with the amount of yes’s they hear. It’s estimated that children hear 148,000 no’s and don’ts before they are grown, and most of those happen when they are very young. If we simply celebrate them when they are doing something right or we tell them “yes” to counteract the feeling that so many things “can’t be done” then we take a huge step in creating balance and helping our children’s growth instead of stunting it. This also helps them to not feel that Islam is all about haram instead of halal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a farmer and focusing on your crop by implementing these techniques over time can help you raise psychologically sound children with a strong sense of identity who are at ease in their personality. So that when your child is asked, “Who are you?” they can confidently respond that they are a Muslim who is intelligent, beautiful, happy, proud, or fill in the blank with any positive traits that fits their personality.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this installment of Musings of a Foodie, Fatima Bheekoo-Shah relates how Sunday lunch is making a comeback in her home. 
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sundays are like a double-edged sword for me. Whilst it is still the weekend, it also a day closer to Monday, when the mad dash to get to work and school on time begins. Sundays were also made for long leisurely lunches with family. The kind where the table is groaning under the sheer weight of the amount of food piled on top of it. Roast chicken or lamb, roasted potatoes, plump sweet yellow rice, carrots, caramelised butternut, the unique South African gem squash which should have pools of melted butter in them, and salads complete the main part of the meal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sundays also take me back to my granny and her salt and pepper roast chicken.  It was so delicious that even after more than twenty years that meal still remains sharp in my memory. I remember everything from the crispy golden-brown chicken sizzling with some potatoes in an electric frying pan to the aroma that embraced you the minute you came in through the front door. Sunday was just not Sunday without it. I have tried and tried to copy that recipe and get it right, but I still do not get any closer to the way my granny makes it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I have taken to cooking Sunday lunch. I used to be happy to get take-out or have a late breakfast and just have a light supper. But Sundays are our only day as a family when we can have leisurely lunch together.  So I try to make the effort and cook and the best part is there is no rush as everyone is quite happy to eat when the food is done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roasted anything is usually on the menu, but to make the hubby happy it has to be the customary roast leg of lamb. After years of experimenting, I think I have found the perfect recipe for us. After I freshly grind the roasted spices and marinate the meat, I sear the meat to get that perfect golden brown colour, then into a slow oven to roast for a few hours. Once the meat has cooked and all the lovely juices have oozed out, I throw in a few parboiled potatoes and roast them to perfection in the meat juices. We usually have the meat with some roasted veg, rice and a green salad. Dessert is often much later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I go through all this trouble because there are very few things that bring such genuine happiness and closeness into homes as a proper Sunday lunch. And the reason for this is not because of the food, but because of the laughter and memories that are formed around the table. I suppose it’s like that all over the world. Every person, no matter how rich or poor, has a memory that is directly related to food. Whether it is your mother giving you warm chicken soup and toast when you are ill or your BFF feeding you chocolate cake when you are feeling down or just having ramen noodles with the kids, everyone has a food memory. These memories are what holds communities and families together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the task of perfecting my granny’s roast chicken recipe still continues…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><em><strong>My Roasted Leg Of Lamb Recipe</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
<em>The lamb</em><br />
• 2kg good quality leg of lamb<br />
• 5 whole cloves of garlic<br />
• 1 red chilli<br />
• 1 tsp mustard powder<br />
• 2 tbsp roasted coriander seeds<br />
• ½ tsp roasted cumin seeds<br />
• 1 small bunch of fresh coriander leaves<br />
• 2 tbsp olive oil<br />
• Freshly ground black pepper &#8211; be generous!<br />
• Zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mint sauce</em><br />
• 4 tbsp chopped fresh mint leaves<br />
• 1 tsp sugar<br />
• 2 pinches salt<br />
• 1 tbsp hot water<br />
• 3 tbsp white vinegar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Preheat your oven to 160°C.<br />
2. In a small kitchen processor, grind all the herbs and spices to a fine, smooth paste.<br />
3. Make deep slits with a sharp knife in your meat. Smear the paste all over the lamb, making sure you get the paste well into the slits.<br />
4. Seal your lamb on a hot grill if you wish, then place it in the oven directly on the rack.<br />
5. Cook the lamb for about an hour and 30 minutes if you want it pink or another half hour if you want it more well done.<br />
6. Meanwhile, prepare your mint sauce. To make the mint sauce, mix the chopped mint, sugar, salt, hot water and vinegar.<br />
7. Take the lamb out of the oven and cover with tin foil. Leave for 15 minutes before serving. Carve and serve with roasted potatoes and mint sauce.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Khadijah Stott-Andrew discusses the flaws and benefits of the different approaches to problem solving. 
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emotions are something everyone experiences, even if we prefer not to advertise them. Contrary to popular belief, internal emotional conflict is not specific to one particular gender. Emotions stem from chemical hormones in the body &#8211; something all of mankind were created with. What sets us apart, male or female, is how we process them. It is often assumed that there are only two ways to face these feelings:</p>
<p>1. Practically and rationally.<br />
2. Succumbing to the emotions without logical thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, is it really this black and white? Or is it possible to handle situations rationally whilst also nurturing sensitivities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to think that there was no way to do both. I was a young creature of feeling and constantly allowed my hormones to guide my actions, wishing I could be logical but believing it to be impossible. Exposure to certain ideas, whether reading books or watching movies, had convinced me that there was no alternative way to handle my problems other than to “follow my heart” and do what “feels right”. This methodology obscured my judgement and lead me into many unnecessary conflicts, purely because I was acting on my feelings, rather than the facts at hand. And that is how I lived for most of my life. That is until I got married. The natural and expected discord I experienced in those early days encouraged me to approach problem solving in a different manner. I learnt to take a step back from my emotions to look at a problem logically, whilst still accepting and coping with any emotional turmoil that came my way. I have learnt to recognise whether my reactions are based on an emotional trigger or a logical one. When about to start a heated discussion, my husband will often hear me say, “I’m all hormonal at the moment, sorry!” and I will give myself some space to work through my emotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #72aba0;"><strong>Keeping emotions in check </strong></span><br />
“How do you know the difference between a logical reaction and a physiological one?” I have been asked. I’m not saying I always make the correct judgment call, not by a long shot, but I tend to realise when I am being irrational once I sit down and think (or write!) through my problem. Once I see there is no logical reason for my level of upset, I can put the issue down to my emotions. Sometimes I find I have a genuine concern and the problem needs to be addressed, but my response has been an overreaction and has even hindered the solutions at hand. This is when a logical approach is imperative. When this happens, I give myself a day to cool down and choose something to help cheer me up. When I am no longer stressed by the problem, I think it through again. This usually has two outcomes &#8211; either I am no longer bothered or even see it as a problem, or I have a greater clarity of mind to engage in a productive and useful solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #72aba0;"><strong>Don’t suppress!</strong></span><br />
I am by no means encouraging the habit of ignoring our emotions or suppressing problems. Just because we are attempting to control and manage emotions, does not mean we are denying their validity. You must still acknowledge that you are upset and allow yourself to feel that emotion, without adding guilt or shame into the mix. Whether the problem is the situation or your reaction, something needs addressing and deserves equal attention. Learn to accept that being unhappy and distressed is OK, and sometimes we even need to cry for no reason other than to detox our minds. Feeling guilty for crying can sometimes fuel negative emotions and pull you down even further, magnifying your problems. Even now I still fall into the trap of scolding myself for “unnecessary crying”. This self-abuse intensifies the calamity and even destroys the strength you need to pick yourself back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #72aba0;"><strong>Managing emotions effectively</strong></span><br />
Like anything, there are clear steps you can take to solve a problem you have. It is recommended to practice these steps whilst calm and with a clear mind. Just like breathing exercises should be mastered in order to be useful during times of stress, these steps must be practised to help you follow them through smoothly when they are truly needed. Remembering these steps structures your thoughts during a time when emotional upset is attempting to cloud your judgement. Dr. Darlene Mininni addresses appropriate emotional management in her book, The Emotional Toolkit. Dr. Mininni explains the importance of identifying your exact emotion before tackling it. To do this, she divides emotions into four categories:</p>
<p><strong><em>Anxiety</em></strong> &#8211; often accompanied by thoughts of “what if&#8230;?” as you worry about things that could go wrong.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sadness</em></strong> &#8211; includes negative thoughts along with a heavy, tired feeling. Often you might cry or have trouble concentrating.</p>
<p><strong><em>Anger</em></strong> &#8211; angry thoughts are usually focused on ways that you or even your values have been attacked.</p>
<p><strong><em>Happiness</em></strong> &#8211; when you’re happy, your mind is focused on things you have gained and you’ll feel light and calm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once identified, you can then address the emotion by asking yourself what the message of the emotion is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anxiety &#8211; What am I afraid of?<br />
Sadness &#8211; What have I lost?<br />
Anger &#8211; How have I/my values been attacked?<br />
Happiness &#8211; What have I gained?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have calculated an answer to these questions (again, writing out your thoughts would be massively therapeutic and help you focus) you can begin to work out what actions you wish to take in order to manage the problem you find yourself with. Sometimes, you might even find that there is no way for you to handle the situation &#8211; there is a chance it could be completely out of your hands. In this case, you can focus your attention on coping with the emotion you’re feeling and working through it. For example, by acknowledging your anger, you can attempt to manage it through deep breathing or even meditation. Maintaining awareness of an emotion will better equip you to deal with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The techniques you will use to cope with your emotions will be completely unique to yourself. Whether you prefer to read a book, go shopping with a friend or just tuck into a slice of cake, there is one extra technique that we should all utilise relentlessly. The Mercy, Majesty and ultimate Power of Allah (SWT) is a blessing we should never ignore. There are numerous verses in the Noble Qur’an where Allah (SWT) provides beautiful words of comfort for painful or upsetting situations. It can be hugely uplifting to reflect on these verses, research the <em>tafsir</em> (explanations) and gain a deeper understanding of the words of our Lord. After all, Allah I is the One who has presented us with our trials and problems, and He is the only One who can bring us safely out of them again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #72aba0;"><strong><em>For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.</em></strong></span> <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Ash-Sharĥ:5-6)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #72aba0;"><em><strong>Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Little do you remember.</strong></em></span><span style="color: #999999;"> <em>(An-Naml:62)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<em><span style="color: #72aba0;"><strong> &#8220;Peace be upon you for what you patiently endured. And excellent is the final home.&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color: #999999;">(Ar-Ra`d:24)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #72aba0;"><em><strong>Those to whom hypocrites said, &#8220;Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them.&#8221; But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said, &#8220;Sufficient for us is Allah , and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs.&#8221;</strong></em></span> <em>(<span style="color: #999999;">Al ‘Imran:173)</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #72aba0;">And those who disbelieved say, &#8220;Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?&#8221; Say, [O Muhammad], &#8220;Indeed, Allah leaves astray whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him] -Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured.&#8221;</span> </em></strong><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Ar-Ra`d:27-28)</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #72aba0;">Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said,&#8221;When is the help of Allah ?&#8221; Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near.</span> </em></strong><span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Al-Baqarah:214)</em></span><br />
<strong><em><span style="color: #72aba0;"> O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.</span></em></strong> <span style="color: #999999;"><em>(Al-Baqarah:153)</em></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">Children and their parents enjoyed an adventure in the heart of the countryside as they escaped the turmoil of trying to rebuild their lives following the tower block fire eight months ago.  <u></u>Many are still living in hotels and temporary accommodation as they battle with authorities to find new homes and restore their lives.</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing"><u></u></p>

<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">A party of around 20 parents and children spent four days far away from their neighbourhood where the blackened shell of the tower acts as a constant reminder of their trauma.  <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6980" src="https://www.sisters-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_8722_preview.jpeg" alt="" width="1" height="1" />They visited a farm &#8211; and for some it was their first time feeding animals – walked in the woods and tried archery, climbing, campfire and den-building and woodland skills in the trip organised by Al Khair Foundation, a leading UK Muslim charity and its implementing partner Hear Women Foundation.</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">

We have been in the community providing practical and emotional support since the fire but felt the children would benefit from having a break in the countryside.”</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">Hisam Choucair, who lost six family members who lived on the 22<sup>nd</sup> floor, came on the trip with his children, Zahraa aged seven and Muhammed five. <u></u>“The outdoor life and the greenery are natural therapeutic things to bring joy to people at difficult times, especially for the children,” he said.<span class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u>“My children found this trip enjoyable. Everything has been taken away from them and they must feel empty and lonely.&#8221;</p>

I feel very empty, it’s not easy not having people around you.

I’m broken but I have to stay strong for others especially my children. There’s not a moment that goes by that I don’t think of my family.”</p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">Hisam, who lives seven minutes from the tower, alleges that the authorities wouldn’t let children visit the tower to pay their respects. <u></u>“It was only after I challenged them for a month on this matter that they changed their view and are allowing the children to visit the tower at a later stage. This has only been confirmed verbally via the authorities to myself but nothing has been confirmed in writing.”<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">“They were saying before that the children couldn&#8217;t even visit the outside perimeters to pay their respects,” he said. “What I saw on that day, is no different to what my children saw. There’s no reason why they can’t visit. It’s very sad that we have to challenge them. <u></u>“To say to one that you can come in but another can’t is an insult to my family and me.  <u></u>They should make it as easy as possible for people to overcome this but they are putting obstacles in the way just to make a visit.”<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing"> Mahad Ali Abdullah, who lived opposite Grenfell Tower, took his two children, Mohamed aged 18 and Safa 12, on the holiday, which was run by Surrey Outdoor Learning and Development at their centre near Dorking. <u></u>“It’s very beautiful here and we are disconnected from the outside world so it’s giving us full tranquillity. My children really enjoyed it,” he said.<span class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657apple-converted-space"> </span><u></u>“It was very positive and exciting.

<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing">
<p class="m_-2288006224705549348m_1056268633648504657MsoNoSpacing"> Hisam’s sister Sawsan Choucair, who also lost six members of their family, said: “It’s a lovely place. It’s brilliant for the kids. There are lots of activities and people here are very friendly. We get together, have a talk and watch TV.  It was a change and something different outside of London. I’ve never been down this way. There’s a nice atmosphere and the children loved seeing all the animals and riding ponies.  The organisers and the workers were lovely, so friendly, everyone was fantastic and did anything to please us. We have all been traumatised since Grenfell. The people from Grenfell tower have gone through a lot. They need something for them.  This has let the kids have a good time.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Fatima Bheekoo-Shah shares a breakfast recipe that might just become a staple in your repertoire.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eggs are one of the most nutritious foods you can find. I love eggs in all forms: fried, scrambled, poached and boiled. When I want something different though, shakshuka is my staple. Poaching eggs in a flavoursome, aromatic tomato sauce is all the rage in South Africa. It is warming, comforting and nutritious. This dish is ideal for the days you wake up feeling in the mood for a simple culinary challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Shakshuka has been a part of the cuisine of North Africa and the Middle East for many years. They have many variations on this theme depending on the country in which it’s made, with sauces varying in spiciness, sweetness and sharpness. You can add preserved lemon to your shakshuka &#8211; or why not try harissa paste, olives or even sausage? This recipe is also a great side dish at the brunch table. Most importantly, have loads of crisp sourdough bread on hand to mop up the juices!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #a80000;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></span><br />
• 1 tbsp olive oil<br />
• 1 medium brown or white onion, peeled and diced<br />
• 1 clove garlic, minced<br />
• 1 medium green or red bell pepper, chopped<br />
• 4 cups ripe diced tomatoes, or 2 cans (400 ml each) diced tomatoes<br />
• 2 tbsp tomato paste<br />
• 1 tsp chilli powder (mild)<br />
• 1 tsp cumin<br />
• 1 tsp paprika<br />
• A pinch of cayenne pepper (or more to taste if you like it spicy!)<br />
• A pinch of sugar (optional, to taste)<br />
• Salt and pepper to taste<br />
• 5-6 eggs<br />
• Freshly chopped coriander (optional, for garnish)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #a80000;"><strong>Method</strong></span><br />
1. Heat a deep, large skillet or sauté pan on a medium heat. Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion and sauté for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
2. Add garlic and continue to sauté until mixture is fragrant. Add the bell pepper and sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened. Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, and stir until blended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
3. Add spices and sugar (if using), stir well and allow mixture to simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes until it starts to reduce. At this point, you can taste the mixture and spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
4. Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the sauce. I usually place 4-5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the centre. The eggs will cook &#8220;over easy&#8221; style on top of the tomato sauce. Cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
5. Keep an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn&#8217;t reduce too much, which can lead to burning. Some people prefer their shakshuka eggs more runny. If this is your preference, let the sauce reduce for a few minutes before cracking the eggs on top. Then, cover the pan and cook the eggs to taste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
6. Garnish with the chopped coriander, if desired. Shakshuka can be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner. For breakfast, serve with warm crusty bread or pita that can be dipped into the sauce.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paris, capital of love and romance, is often seen as a museum-city, a beacon of classicism and high fashion. France, however, has a very long history with Islam, from al-Andalus which reached the south of the country to the disasters of colonialism, and today France is a multicultural society with the largest Muslim community in Europe. While it has often been a conflictual relationship, France is a country deeply influenced by its Maghrebi and African communities: the French’s favourite dish is Moroccan couscous! An estimated five million Muslims live in France, contributing to every aspect of social, cultural and political life. Paris is a relatively small city with a good transport system, and it is easy to walk everywhere here. One word of warning though: the metro system is not wheelchair friendly, and it is difficult to access with prams, so make sure to take a baby carrier or a foldable stroller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #48c3f0;"><strong>What to see</strong></span><br />
Beyond Paris’s popular tourists spots such as the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower, there is plenty to do for couples and families. True, Parisians are not famous for being particularly welcoming, but the beauty of the city largely makes up for it. There is something to suit all tastes, with a large number of museums, halal restaurants, shopping galleries, markets and parks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barbès, in the North of Paris, is considered the North African area, with countless little cafés to enjoy a glass of fresh mint tea and almond delicacies, but it is in fact the Latin Quarter that historically hosted Arab immigrants. The Paris Grand mosque (metro stop: Place Monge), built in 1926 to thank Muslim soldiers who fought alongside France against Germany, is a little peaceful oasis with its gorgeous courtyards, and it has its own café and traditional hammam (Pro tip: you might be asked for an entrance fee as tourists are allowed in parts of the mosque. Do not pay! Say you are coming in to pray).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After prayers, walk down towards the Seine and visit the Arab World Institute (IMA) on the riverside, where they organise various events and exhibitions about Arab culture, including crafts and storytelling for children. Pop up to their terrace on the top floor and enjoy the panoramic views of Notre-Dame. When you leave, have a look at the local Arab bookshops, such as Librairie Avicenne which holds a wide collection of Islamic books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paris has a large number of museums and it would be a shame not to visit a few if you have time. The recently opened Institute of Islamic Cultures in Barbès is worth a visit: they exhibit young Muslim artists, and they even organise workshops in zellige and mosaic making, iftar cooking, poetry and much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Louvre has a lesser known but extensive department of Islamic art, comprising a large selection of objects from Spain to South Asia. Two more destinations for art lovers: the Quai Branly museum, next to the Eiffel Tower, is a fascinating space collecting artefacts from a large variety of cultures, and it is very family friendly. The Maison Rouge museum (metro stop Bastille) is a relatively unknown space showing emerging artists, perfect as an alternative to the very touristy Pompidou museum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a bit of fresh air, head to Jardin des Plantes or Jardin du Luxembourg, two favourite spots for Parisians: these are the perfect spots for a lazy afternoon of reading and enjoying the manicured gardens. Both have playgrounds for children, and the Jardin des Plantes also has a small zoo, one of the oldest in the world. There is a larger zoo in Parc de Vincennes, recently refurbished with five large biozones reproducing animals’ native environments. This is a fun way to introduce children to the variety of Allah’s (SWT) creation!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a long day out, have a walk around the Ile St Louis on the river Seine and get an ice cream from the famous Berthillon. Continue your stroll along the riverside, particularly enjoyable in the summer. Alternatively, walk up the stairs to the Sacré-Coeur Basilica in Montmartre, where you can enjoy the most breathtaking views over the city and visit one of the prettiest areas of the city, once famous for its painters and artists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A trip to Paris necessarily includes a shopping stop; why not plan your holiday during the sales season and bag a few bargains? The Printemps Haussman (metro Havre Caumartin) is a large department store where you will find everything you need. Le Bon Marché (metro Sèvres Babylone) is smaller, but also includes a food hall for foodies! For a more original experience, visit one of the many flea markets (the biggest one is St Ouen, metro Garibaldi) and browse the antiques. In addition, every April the Bourget Muslim fair is organised, the biggest event for Muslims in the country with dozens of exhibitors. Favourite brands amongst French Muslim ladies include Misstoura, Ines à Paris and Fringadine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #48c3f0;"><strong>Where to eat</strong></span><br />
There’s a huge range of halal restaurants available, including ones selling gourmet French cuisine such as Les Enfants Terribles (metro Parmentier) and Le Jumeyrah (metro Rue St Maur), which are well worth a visit for a local culinary experience, while being halal. Other popular restaurants include La Troika Libanaise (metro Charles Michel) or Moroccan Atlas Couscous (metro Alesia). Please note, the large majority of ‘halal’ restaurants in Paris serve alcohol; I have tried to include the few that don’t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cafés and takeaway shops selling kebab, Lebanese falafel or Tunisian spicy tuna sandwiches for a quick snack are pretty much everywhere, particularly in Muslim areas. For those of you with a sweet tooth, there are also a number of famous North African bakeries serving delicious delicacies: Algerian brand La bague de Kenza has a number of shops throughout the city and is worth a trip. Tunisian La Rose de Tunis sells pistachio baklava and date makroud that are to die for. To finish, learn French Patisserie at the newly opened Halal cooking school (metro Cadet) and make your own macarons!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #48c3f0;"><strong>Where to pray</strong></span><br />
Apart from the Grand Mosque, most masaajid are located in the North East of the city, in the areas of Barbès or Belleville/Couronnes. Many are small and don’t have sisters’ facilities; the ones that do are: Omar mosque (metro Parmentier), Khalid Ibn Walid mosque (metro Chateau-Rouge), Abou Baker Assidiq mosque (metro Couronnes). There are also larger mosques just outside of Paris in Evry, Créteil and Clichy, amongst others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #48c3f0;"><strong>Beyond Paris</strong></span><br />
If you are feeling adventurous, head outside of the city to the Versailles Castle, a popular tourist spot, and why not pass through Disneyland in Marne-La-Vallée for a memorable family day out. There is no need to say any more about these two iconic attractions, so this is just a reminder that both are great outings for a day away from the city. Fontainebleau Forest is further afield, but easily accessible from Paris, and it will delight nature lovers. It is a very large, protected reserve particularly known for rock climbing and perfect for little explorers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope to see you soon in Paris, insha Allah!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been several years since I got married, and even more since I have been witnessing the difficulties in the marriages of a few Muslim friends: sisters who seek my personal counsel now and then. In retrospect, if there is one thing I have learned, it is the wisdom behind Allah’s description of one of the prime qualities of righteous Muslim wives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">“Therefore, the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to the husband), and guard in (the husband’s) absence what Allah would have them guard…”</span> </strong>[Quran &#8211; 4:34]  </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I studied the Qur’an at first, as a young teenager, I did not understand why the angels Hārut and Mārut were sent with the ability to teach witchcraft (called “sihr” in Arabic), as a fitnah for mankind, with this “magic” described further in the Qur’an as “that which creates discord between a man and his wife.” <em>[Quran &#8211; 2:102]  </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years of experience have taught me the great Divine wisdom behind Allah’s laws, commands and words. I have also significantly understood why people want to cause dissension between a husband and wife. It happens more subtly and rampantly than we naively believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let us accept the fact that the reason why the husband-wife relationship is the prime target of Satan, our avowed enemy, is that it forms the foundation of the happy, hearty, productive Muslim family unit. This unit is, in turn, the foundation of a righteous society. If this relationship is good, the Muslim home functions smoothly, and the next generation of Muslims grows up morally and spiritually upright. However, if the husband-wife relationship is rocky and tumultuous, it undermines the emotional well-being of every individual in the family, particularly the children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing helps raise better children than righteous Muslim parents who are emotionally close, compatible like good friends, and incessantly loving towards each other. If the parents are practicing Muslims as individuals, but do not get along well with each other, the children will not be able to grow up feeling emotionally secure and confident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early days, a husband or wife – or both – usually continue to seek advice and guidance in their personal matters from their parents, out of  habit:  both are young, inexperienced in making independent decisions, and not very close to each other. However, parents on both sides should discourage this in the long term as it can undermine the pair’s close relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine the wife always turning to her mother, father, sibling or friend when she faces any problem, be it a pregnancy-related ailment, a plumbing fault in the kitchen, or – Allah save us – intimate details of her last fight with her husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the husband might consult only his father for financial and career advice, or his siblings or friends when worried about some workplace problem, giving his wife attention only when retiring to bed at night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If both spouses continue thus, it will not be long before things take a downturn between them. This is because, no matter how close someone else might have been to the husband or wife before marriage, continuing to confide in them instead of their spouse will make them find out intimate marital details, which in turn will make them involved. Interference and conflict will be the obvious outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parents of the couple like to feel needed even after the marriage and take their time to let go. It is, however, entirely up to the wise couple to keep their personal matters to themselves; even something as trivial as what they had for dinner, what ornament they just bought for their living room, or what they plan to do with the annual job bonus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early in the marriage, say within one or two years, if things are not rectified, a wedge will form between the couple, and it can continue to keep them emotionally apart from each other with each passing year, even if they continue to occupy the same bed and have children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In joint family systems, it is the wife who usually compromises, because she has little personal privacy or independence, and has to always “share” her husband with his relatives. More often than not, he continues to be close only to his family, treating his wife as just a housekeeper and child-bearer. He comes home and unburdens himself on his parents and siblings, whilst his wife is busy with the household chores. A wife might feel like talking to her husband after his day at work, but as soon as she sits with him, his mother may ask her to make the tea. When she leaves, her husband will then talk to his mother. This can make his wife seethe with frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Many women piously put up with this compromise on their basic marital rights without protest, year after year. However, this acquiescence undermines their long-term marital happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said before, it is entirely up to the individual husband and wife themselves to keep their guard up about divulging their personal matters to their families, whilst maintaining their mutual closeness. Polite but firm tight-lipped-ness should meet questions like, “So, are you in the family way yet?”, “Did you find out at the last ultrasound if it’s a boy or a girl?” or “What salary are you getting since your promotion?” We must remember that our parents and relatives love us and are concerned about us, however, whether their concern transforms into meddling is totally up to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, individual families are always much more complex, and marital problems cannot be painted with a wide, generalising brush. Some couples are very open and accommodating with their respective families, with everyone living together very cordially, sharing everything in life without any problems. Each case is different, and what might work for some, could cause problems for others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best advice I can give to a married person is this: whenever you have to unburden yourself about a problem, or seek counsel before a major decision, or just need to vent your emotions:</p>
<p>1.  Turn to your spouse first &#8211; yes, even before you talk to your parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.  Consult your spouse, even if you have mentally decided what to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.  Conceal your spouse’s faults behind their back, and if someone mentions these fault(s) without just cause before you, be quick to come to their defence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, spending time together, openly communicating, and being emotionally available and responsive to your spouse is of prime importance for the marital relationship. Other relationships can be given their dues without compromising the closeness between husband and wife. This needs discretion, wisdom and tact, not to mention fear of Allah and conscious obedience of His commands.</p>
